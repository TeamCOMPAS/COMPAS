This makes a notebook, like code snippets, more modular and easier to implement in other routines. In addition to the notes we try to offer the 'plain, but commented' python (.py) files for implementation into larger pipelines.\n",

In addition please refrain from putting your name on post-processing code as much as possible. Even a single script is often a collaborative effort and your contributions will be noted in the Logbook or the paper to which some pipelines are linked. Codes are often written based on ideas from others (stackoverflow) or many iterations with collaborators. That said, adding a stackoverflow link here and there can be very useful :D "
