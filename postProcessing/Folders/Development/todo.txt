THIS IS NOT A REPLACEMENT FOR THE GIT WORKFLOW!!


Here we present a TODO/wish list for the post-Processing routine.
This is merely a reminder. Any official enhancements/bugs of postProcessing
 should be done through the official git workflow. 

0 - Informal reminders/wishlists that you dont want in the main git.

1 - During a conversation you know COMPAS will change and
    therefore post-Processing needs to be changed in the future.
    
2 - You have a cool idea for a future implementation, 
    which is not necessarily a needed enhancement.

Despite it being informal try to be concise and clear and only add something
which you believe you might or someone else might do. 
This way someone else may be able to help/solve it for you.
If you have finished something please don't forget to remove it here too. 
The initials are there for people to be able to ask for clarification, 
not to assign any projects since that happens through git. 
Check with that person if they already started , to collaborate and not 
have 5 people working on the same small thing. We order them by the 
oldest addition first since these should in principle be done first :)
