h5copy.py 

This program copies HDF5 file(s) to a designated output HDF5 file.  If the output file is
an existing HDF5 file, the user can specify whether the existing content should be erased
before copying begins, or whether the copied data should be appended to the existing data.


Some nomenclature
=================

A COMPAS output file (e.g. BSE_System_Parameters, BSE_RLOF, etc.) maps to an HDF5 GROUP,
where the group name is the name of the COMPAS output file.

A column in a COMPAS output file (e.g. SEED, Mass(1), Radius(2), etc.) maps to an HDF5 DATASET,
where the dataset name is the column heading string.

COMPAS column datatype strings are encoded in the dataset meta-details (dataset.dtype).
COMPAS column units strings are attached to HDF5 datasets as attributes.

Functionality overview
======================

Output file
-----------

- If the specified HDF5 output file does not exist, it will be created, and data from the input
  file(s) will be appended to the new output file.

- If the specified HDF5 output file does exist, and the -e commandline option is not present, the
  existing output file will be preserved and data from the input file(s) will be appended to the
  existing output file if the output file was created with chunking enabled (see description of
  HDF5 chunking below - only files that were created with chunking enabled can be extended).

  Attempting to append data to an existing HDF5 file that was not created with chunking enabled
  will result in the following message being displayed for each dataset:

      "Only chunked datasets can be resized"

  If that happens, using this program to copy the output file to a new file will copy the existing
  data and create the newf file with chunking enabled - the newly created file can then be used as
  a base file to which other files can be appended.

- If the specified HDF5 output file does exist, and the -e commandline option is present, the
  existing output file will be deleted, and new, empty, file created, and data from the input
  file(s) will be appended to the new output file.

When appending data:

   (a) if a group in an input file already exists in the output file, then the group data (the
       datasets within the group) will only be copied if the number of datasets in the input
       file group matches the number of datasets in the output file group.  If there is a mismatch
       a warning will be issued and the group will not be copied (but the file copy will continue,
       just as though the group had been excluded) 
   
   (b) if a dataset in an input file does not exist in the output file, the dataset will be created,
       otherwise the data copied will be appended to the existing dataset.


Input files
-----------

A list of input filenames and or directory names must be supplied.  The list can be a single name.
Each name in the list is processed in order.  If a name is the name of a file with the file extension
'.h5', the contents of the file will be copied to the output file, otherwise it will be ignored.
If a name is the name of a directory and the specified recursion level requires that the directory
be processed (see commandline option -r), the program will descend into the directory and process all
files and directories there (directories will be processed depending upon the value of the -r option),
otherwise it will be ignored.

The commandline option '-r' specifies whether recursion is enabled for directory processing, and if
it is, to what depth:

    if the -r option is not present, recursion is not enabled and only files in the specified working 
    directory will be candidates for copying

    if -r is present with no 'depth' value, recursion is enabled and the depth is not limited - that
    is, all files in the specified working directory, and all files in all directories below the 
    specified working directory, will be candidates for copying
    
    if -r is present with a specified 'depth' value, recursion is enabled and the depth is limited to
    the depth specified - that is, all files in the specified working directory, and all files in all 
    directories 'depth' levels below the specified working directory, will be candidates for copying
    

Input filename filter
---------------------

If the -f commandline option is present, the names of all candidate files will be checked against the
specified filter, and only files whose names match the filter will be copied.  The specified filter
is a filename-only filter - the file's path (i.e. it's location) will not be matched to the filter.
The specified filter should not include a file extension, but the program adds the extension '.h5' to
the specified filter - only files that have the file extension '.h5' will match the filter.

If the -f option is not present the program uses a default filter value of '*', then adds the '.h5'
file extension - so all candidate files with the '.h5' extension will be copied.


Exclude group list
------------------

If the -x commandline option is present, the specified list of groupnames will be excluded from data
copied from all input files.  If -x is not present, all groups in all candidate files will be copied.


Erase output
------------

If the -e commandline option is present and the output file (specified or default) exists, it will be
erased before copying begins.  The -e option is ignored if the output file does not exist.

If -e is not present and the output file (specified or default) exists, the existing content will be
preserved and any data copied to the file will be appended to the existing data.


HDF5 file chunking and IO
=========================

(mostly copied from the intro to COMPAS source file log.h, so some bits might be specific to the
COMPAS C++ code)

A brief description of HDF5 files and chunking, in the COMPAS context:
(With the caveat that all I know about HDF5 I learned so that I could write this code - it is
very likely that there are better ways to do things, so if anyone knows a better way, please
either change the code or tell me how to improve it and I'll change it.  Most of what follows
is just a brain dump of my reading/research over the past week or so, and it could very well
be based on my misunderstanding of what I have read - so uf anyone notices something I've
misunderstood please let me know so I can improve the code.)
 

Data in HDF5 files are arranged in groups and datasets.

    A COMPAS output file (e.g. BSE_System_Parameters, BSE_RLOF, etc.) maps to an HDF5 group,
    where the group name is the name of the COMPAS output file.

    A column in a COMPAS output file (e.g. SEED, Mass(1), Radius(2), etc.) maps to an HDF5 dataset,
    where the dataset name is the column heading string.

    COMPAS column datatype strings are encoded in the dataset meta-details (dataset.dtype).
    COMPAS column units strings are attached to HDF5 datasets as attributes.

Each dataset in an HDF5 files is broken into "chunks", where a chunk is defined as a number of dataset
entries.  In COMPAS, all datasets are 1-d arrays (columns), so a chunk is defined as a number of values
in the 1-d array (or column).  Chunking can be enabled or not, but if chunking is not* enabled a dataset
cannot be resized - so if chunking is not enabled the size of the dataset must be known at the time of
creation, and the entire datset created in one go.  That doesn't work for COMPAS - even though we know
the number of systems being evolved, we don't know the number of entries we'll have in each of the output
log files (and therefore the HDF5 datasests if we're logging to HDF5 files).  So, we enable chunking.
 
Chunking can improve, or degrade, performance depending upon how it is implemented - mostly related to
the chunk size chosen.
 
Datasets are stored inside an HDF5 file as a number of chunks - the chunks are not guaranteed (not even
likely) to be contiguous in the file or on the storage media (HDD, SSD etc.).  Chunks are mapped/indexed
in the HDF5 file using a B-tree, and the size of the B-tree, and therefore the traversal time, depends 
directly upon the number of chunks allocated for a dataset - so the access time for a chunk increases as
the number of chunks in the dataset increases.  So many small chunks will degrade performance.
 
Chunks are the unit of IO for HDF5 files - all IO to HDF5 is performed on the basis of chunks.  This means
that whenever dataset values are accessed (read or written (i.e. changed)), if the value is not already in
memory, the entire chunck containing the value must be read from, or written to, the storage media - even
if the dataset value being accessed is the only value in the chunk.  So few large chunks could cause 
empty, "wasted", space in the HDF5 files (at the end of datasets) - but they could also adversely affect
performance by causing unecessary IO traffic (although probably not much in the way we access data in COMPAS
files).
 
HDF5 files implement a chunk cache on a per-dataset basis.  The default size of the chunk cache is 1MB, and
its maximum size is 32MB.  The purpose of the chunk cache is to reduce storage media IO - even with SSDs,
memory access is way faster than storage media access, so the more of the file data that can be kept in
memory and maipulated there, the better.  Assuming the datatype of a particular dataset is DOUBLE, and
therefore consumes 8 bytes of storage space, at its maximum size the chunk cache for that dataset could hold
4,000,000 values - so a single chuck with 4,000,000 values, two chunks with 2,000,000 values, four with 
1,000,000, and so on.  Caching a single chunk defeats the purpose of the cache, so chunk sizes somewhat less
that 4,000,000 would be most appropriate if the chunk cache is to be utilised.  Chunks too big to fit in the
cache simply bypass the cache and are read from, or written to, the storage media directly.
 
However, the chunk cache is really only useful for random access of the dataset.  Most, if not all, of the
access in the COMPAS context (including post-creation analyses) is serial - the COMPAS code writes the
datasets from top to bottom, and later analyses (generally) read the datasets the same way.  Caching the
chunks for serial access just introduces overhead that costs memory (not much, to be sure: up to 32MB per 
open dataset), and degrades performace (albeit it a tiny bit).  For that reason I disable the chunk cache
in COMPAS - so all IO to/from an HDF5 file in COMPAS is directly to/from the storage media.  (To be clear,
post-creation analysis software can disable the cache or not when accessing HDF5 files created by COMPAS - 
disabling the cache here does not affect how other software accesses the files post-creation).
 
So many small chunks is not so good, and neither is just a few very large chunks.  So what's the optimum
chunk size?  It depends upon several things, and probably the most important of those are the final size
of the dataset and the access pattern.
 
As mentioned above, we tend to access datasets serially, and generally from to to bottom, so larger chunks 
would seem appropriate, but not so large that we generate HDF5 files with lots of unused space.  However, 
disk space, even SSD space, is cheap, so trading space against performance is probably a good trade.
 
Also as mentioned above, we don't know the final size of (most of) the datasets when creating the HDF5 in
COMPAS - though we do know the number of systems being generated, which allows us to determine an upper
bound for at least some of the datasets (though not for groups such as BSE_RLOF).
 
One thing we need to keep in mind is that when we create the HDF5 file we write each dataset of a group
in the same iteration - this is analagous to writing a single record in (e.g.) a CSV log file (the HDF5
group corresponds to the CSV file, and the HDF5 datasets in the group correspond to the columns in the
CSV file).  So for each iteration - typically each system evolved (though each timestep for detailed
output files) we do as many IOs to the HDF5 file as there are datasets in the group (columns in the file).
We are not bound to reading or writing a single chunk at a time - but we are bound to reading or writing
an integral multiple of whole chunks at a time.
 
We want to reduce the number of storage media accesses when writing (or later reading) the HDF5 files, so
larger chunk sizes are appropriate, but not so large that we create excessively large HDF5 files that have
lots of unused space (bearing in mind the trade-off mentioned above), especially when were evolving just
a few systems (rather than millions).
 
To really optimise IO performance for HDF5 files we'd choose chunk sizes that are close to multiples of
storage media block sizes, but I chose not to go down that rathole...
 
Based on everything written above, and some tests, I've chosen a default chunk size of 100,000 (dataset
entries) for all datasets (HDF5_DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE in constants.h) for the COMPAS C++ code.  This clearly
trades performance against storage space.  For the (current) default logfile record specifications, per-binary
logfile space is about 1K bytes, so in the very worst case we will waste some space at the end of a COMPAS
HDF5 output file, but the performance gain, especially for post-creation analyses, is significant.  Ensuring
the number of systems evolved is an integral multiple of this fixed chunk size will minimise storage space waste.

I have chosen a minimum chunk size of 1000 (HDF5_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE in constants.h) for the COMPAS C++ code.  
If the number of systems being evolved is >= HDF5_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE the chunk size used will be the value of 
the hdf5-chunk-size program option (either HDF5_DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE or a value specified by the user), but if 
the number of systems being evolved is < HDF5_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE the chunk size used will be HDF5_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE.
This is just so we don't waste too much storage space when running small tests - and if they are that small
performance is probably not going to be much of an issue, so no real trade-off against storage space.  

The chunk size chosen for the COMPAS C++ code determines the chunk size of the logfiles produced by the COMPAS
C++ code.  If those files are only ever given to this program as input files, their chunk size only matters
in that it affects the read performance of the files (the more chunks, and the more smaller chunks, in a
dataset of an input file means locating the chunks and reading them takes longer).  That may not be a huge
problem depending upon h ow many input files there are and how big they are.  If a COMPAS logfile is used as
a base file and other files are being appended to it, then the chunk size of the base output file will be the
chunk size used for writing to the file - that could affect performance if it is too small.  That's why the
chunk size is an option, both for this program and for the COMPAS C++ code.

Writing to the output HDF5 file is buffered here - we buffer a number of chunks for each open dataset and write
the buffer to the file when the buffer fills (or a partial buffer upon file close if the buffer is not full).
This IO buffering is not HDF5 or filesystem buffering - this is a an internal implementation here to improve
performance.  The IO buffer size is also an option (both here and in t he COMPAS C++ code).
 
Users should bear in mind that the combination of HDF5 chunk size and HDF5 IO buffer size affect performance,
storage space, and memory usage - so they may need to experiment to find a balance that suits their needs.


A note on string values
=======================

COMPAS writes string data to its HDF5 output files as C-type strings.  Python interprets C-type
strings in HDF5 files as byte arrays - regardless of the specified datatype when written (COMPAS
writes the strings as ASCII data (as can be seen with h5dump), but Python ignores that).  Note that
this affects the values in datasets (and attributes) only, not the dataset names (or group names,
attribute names, etc.).

The only real impact of this is that if the byte array is printed by Python, it will be displayed
as (e.g.) "b'abcde'" rather than just "abcde".  All operations on the data work as expected - it
is just the output that is impacted.  If that's an issue, use .decode('utf-8') to decode the byte
array as a Python string variable.  E.g.

    str = h5File[Group][Dataset][0]
    str is a byte array and print(str) will display (e.g.) b'abcde'

    but

    str = h5File[Group][Dataset][0].decode('utf-8')
    str is a Python string and print(str) will display (e.g.) abcde

Note: HDF5 files not created by COMPAS will not exhibit this behaviour, so for HDF5 files created by
the existing post-processing python scripts the use of .decode() is not only not necessary, it will
fail (because the strings in HDF5 files created by python are already python strings, not byte arrays).
