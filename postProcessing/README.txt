This folder contains a series of scripts and notebooks
to help/guide a user in handling of the data from a 
COMPAS simulation. This is a collaborative effort and 
no single person should claim authorship.


The post-processing is done with a combination of 
python scripts and ipython notebooks. Numpy 
will drop support for python 2.X. Hence the python scripts
and the notebooks will be in python 3.X. 

Notes etc are in ipython notebook, they are mirrored
by their htmls allowing for linked pages in a web environment.
The plain python scripts are also in the respective folders.
I.e. the scripts related to h5 files are in the h5 folder 

You can either read through the htmls made with an example data-set 
starting by opening the overview.html
Alternatively you can navigate to this directory and type:

$ ipython notebook

Open the notebook of interest and set the path to your personal COMPASOutput.h5
 and run the notebooks on your own data.


Good luck....
