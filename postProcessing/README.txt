This folder contains a series of scripts and notebooks
to help/guide a user in handling of the data from a 
COMPAS simulation. If you update or rewrite parts
of these scripts please refrain from claiming authorship.
This is a collaborative effort and putting your names
in the general post-processing might do injustice to previous
efforts on which the scripts are based.


The post-processing is done with a combination of 
python scripts and ipython notebooks. Numpy 
will drop support for python 2.X. Hence the python scripts
and the notebooks will be in python 3.X. 

Notes etc are in in ipython notebook, but the htmls
are accessible even if you dont have ipython notebook.
The plain python scripts are also in the respective folders.
I.e. the scripts related to h5 files are in the h5 folder 

You can either read through the htmls made with an example data-set.
Alternatively you can navigate to this directory and type:

$ ipython notebook

Then set the path to your personal COMPASOutput.h5 and
run the notebooks on your own data.


Good luck....
