// 02.02.02      JR - Oct 07, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       SSE iteration (increment index - Grids worked, range of values wasn't incrementing)
//                                       Errors service (FIRST_IN_FUNCTION errors sometimes printed every time)
//                                       Added code for both SSE and BSE so that specified metallicities be clamped to [0.0, 1.0].  What are reasonable limits?
//                                   Errors service performance enhancement (clean deleted stellar objects from catalog)
//                                   Changed way binary constituent stars masses equilibrated (they now retain their ZAMS mass, but (initial) mass and mass0 changes)
//                                   Add initial stellar type variable - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added change history and version number to constants.h
// 02.02.03      JR - Oct 09, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Initialised all BaseStar.m_Supernova elements (some had not been initialised)
//                                       Fixed regression in BaseStar.cpp (INITIAL_STELLAR_TYPE & INITIAL_STELLAR_TYPE_NAME in StellarPropertyValue())
//                                   Added max iteration check to Newton-Raphson method in SolveKeplersEquation (see constant MAX_KEPLER_ITERATIONS)
// 02.02.04      JR - Oct 09, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       SN kick direction calculation corrected

// 02.02.05      JR - Oct 10, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Determination of Chemically Homogeneous star fixed (threshold calculation)
//                                       Removed checks for RLOF to/from CH stars
//                                       Typos fixed
// 02.02.06      JR - Oct 11, 2019 - Renamed class "CHE" - now class "CH"
//                                   Updated CHE documentation
//                                   Added m_MassesEquilibrated variable to BaseBinaryStar
// 02.02.07      JR - Oct 20, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       CEE printing systems post-stripping - github issue - reworked CE details/pre/post CE - partial fix (BindingEnergy remaining)
//                                       Added RANDOM_SEED to Options::OptionValue() (omitted erroneously)
//                                   Added m_SecondaryTooSmallForDCO variable to BaseBinaryStar - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added m_StellarMergerAtBirth variable to BaseBinaryStar - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added allow-rlof-at-birth program option
//                                       If CHE enabled, or allow-rlof-at-birth option is true, binaries that have one or both stars
//                                       in RLOF at birth will have masses equilibrated, radii recalculated, orbit circularised, and
//                                       semi-major axis recalculated, while conserving angular momentum - then allowed to evolve
//                                   Added allow-touching-at-birth program option
//                                       Binaries that have stars touching at birth (check is done after any equilibration and
//                                       recalculation of radius and separation is done) are allowed to evolve.  Evolve() function
//                                       immediately checks for merger at birth, flags status as such and stops evolution.
//                                   Documentation updated (see updated doc for detailed explanation of new program options)
// 02.03.00      JR - Oct 25, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       removed extraneous delimiter at end of log file records
//                                   Added '--version' option
//                                   Changed minor version number - should have been done at last release - we'll grant the '--version' option minor release status...
// 02.03.01      JR - Nov 04, 2019 - Defect repair:
//                                       removed erroneous initialisation of m_CEDetails.alpha from BaseBinaryStar::SetRemainingCommonValues()
//                                       (CE Alpha was alwas being initialised to 0.0 regardless of program options)
// 02.03.02      JR - Nov 25, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       added check for active log file before closing in Log::Stop()
//                                       added CH stars to MAIN_SEQUENCE and ALL_MAIN_SEQUENCE initializer_lists defined in constants.h
//                                       moved InitialiseMassTransfer() outside 'if' - now called even if not using mass transfer - sets some flags we might need
//                                       added code to recalculate rlof if CH stars are equilibrated in BaseBinaryStar constructor
//                                   Enhancements:
//                                       moved KROUPA constants from AIS class to constants.h
//                                       moved CalculateCDFKroupa() function from AIS class to BaseBinaryStar class
//                                       added m_CHE variable to BaseStar class - also selectable for printing
//                                       added explicit check to ResolveCommonEnvelope() to merge binary if the donor is a main sequence star
//                                   Chemically Homogeneous Evolution changes:
//                                       added check to CheckMassTransfer() in BaseBinaryStar.cpp to merge if CH+CH and touching - avoid CEE
//                                       added code to InitialiseMassTransfer() in BaseBinaryStar.cpp to equilibrate and possibly merge if both CH stars in RLOF
// (Unchanged)   IM - Nov 29, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       changed Disbound -> Unbounded in header strings in constants.h
//                                       left one line in default/example grid file (Grid.txt)
//                                       fix default PPISN mass limit in python submit: 65 Msol -> 60 Msol
// 02.03.03      JR - Dec 04, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       added code to UpdateAttributesAndAgeOneTimestep() in Star.cpp to recalculate stellar attributes after switching to new stellar type
//                                       (addresses discontinuous transitions e.g. CH -> HeMS)
//                                       changed IsPulsationalPairInstabilitySN() in GiantBranch.cpp to call IsPairInstabilitySN() instead of set MASSLESS_REMNANT if remnant mass <= 0.0
//                                       changed CalculateSNKickVelocity() in BaseStar.cpp to set m_SupernovaDetails.kickVelocity correctly after adjusting for fallback
// 02.03.04      FSB - Dec 04, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       fixed bug in Fryer+2012 CalculateGravitationalRemnantMassadded() function to compare baryon mass of star remnant with
//  									                   baryon mass of MaximumNeutronStarMass instead of just MaximumNeutronStarMass. 
//                                       added m_BaryonicMassOfMaximumNeutronStarMass to BaseStar.h and BaseStar.cpp
// 02.03.05      JR - Dec 05, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       fixed EvolveSingleStars() in main.cpp to print correct initial mass
//                                       fixed TPAGB::CalculateCOCoreMassAtPhaseEnd() - added conditional
// 02.04.00      JR - Dec 18, 2019 - New functionality:
//                                       added columns to BSE grid functionality: Kick_Velocity_1(&2), Kick_Theta_1(&2), Kick_Phi_1(&2), Kick_Mean_Anomaly_1(&2).  Updated documentation.
//                                   Changed functionality:
//                                       removed compiler version checks from Makefile - they seemed to only work for native Ubuntu and were more of a nuisance than anything...  (old version exists as Makefile-checks)
//                                   Defect repairs:
//                                       added recalculation of gbParams Mx & Lx in HeHG calculateGbParams()
//                                       created HeHG::CalculateGBParams_Static() and GiantBranch::CalculateGBParams_Static(), called from EAGB::ResolveEnvelopeLoss() to facilitate calculation of attributes for new stellar type before actually switching.  Needed to rewrite some other functions as static.  Note: this needs to be revisited and a more elegant solution implemented.
//                                       added CalculateRadiusAndStellarTypeOnPhase() for HeHG and HeGBstars, and changed call to calculateRadiusOnPhase() to CalculateRadiusAndStellarTypeOnPhase() in BaseStar::EvolveOnPhase().  This allows for HeHG and HeGB stars to change stellar type based on radius (previously missed).
//                                       set M = McBAGB for EAGB & TPAGB only (was being set for all types >= TPAGB)
//                                       added extra print detailed in BaseBinaryStar:Evolve() - sometimes missing a switch type in detailed output if only 1 timestep
//                                       swapped heading strings for ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::IS_ECSN and ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::IS_USSN (now correct)
//                                       removed condition in BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateSupernovae().  ResolveSupernova() is now called for all stellar types (not sure what I was thinking orginally. I'm sure I had a good reason - or maybe I was just tired...)
//                                       changed name of GiantBranch::CalculateProtoCoreMass() to GiantBranch::CalculateProtoCoreMassDelayed() and changed calls to the function
//                                       swapped order of calculations of ePrime (CalculateOrbitalEccentricityPostSupernova()) and m_SemiMajorAxisPrime (CalculateSemiMajorAxisPostSupernova()) in BaseBinaryStar::ResolveSupernova().  Improper order was causing wrong value of m_SeminMajorAxisPrime to be used in calculation of ePrime
//                                       set m_Disbound = true appropriately in BaseBinaryStar::Evolve() (note: m_Disbound will change name to m_Unbound soon...)
//                                       changed return value of CHeB::DetermineEnvelopeType() to CONVECTIVE.  Left CHeB DetermineEnvelopeTypeHurley2002() as RADIATIVE (used in BinaryConstituentStar::CalculateSynchronisationTimescale())
//                                       changed BINARY_PROPERTY::ORBITAL_VELOCITY to BINARY_PROPERTY::ORBITAL_VELOCITY_PRE_2ND_SUPERNOVA in BSE_SUPERNOVAE_REC (6th value printed)
//                                       added p_Erase parameter to Log::CloseStandardFile(); changed Log::CloseAllStandardFiles() to call Log::CloseStandardFile() with p_Erase=false and erase entire map after all files closed (prevent coredump when closing all files)
//                                       added ResolveSupernova() to ONeWD.h - ONeWD stars were previously not checking for SN
//                                       fixed BaseBinaryStar::InitialiseMassTransfer() - star1 was being updated instead of star2 for CH + CH stars when CHE enabled
// 02.04.01      JR - Dec 23, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Removed SN_EVENT::SN - all occurences of SN_EVENT::SN replaced by SN_EVENT::CCSN.
//                                           The current SN event ("Is"), and past SN event ("Experienced") are now bit maps (implemented as Enum Classes).  Each can have any of the values: CCSN, ECSN, PISN, PPSIN, USSN, RUNAWAY, RECYCLED_NS, and RLOF_ONTO_NS.  See definition of SN_EVENT Enum Class in constants.h for implementation and explanation.  
//                                       Updated variables selectable for printing:
//                                           Added ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::SN_TYPE (STAR_PROPERTY, SUPERNOVA_PROPERTY, COMPANION_PROPERTY (should always be SN_EVENT::NONE for companion star))
//                                           Added ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::EXPERIENCED_SN_TYPE (STAR_PROPERTY, SUPERNOVA_PROPERTY, COMPANION_PROPERTY)
//                                           All of ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::{CCSN, ECSN, PISN, PPISN, USSN} now selectable
//                                           Removed ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::SN - no longer selectable for printing (replaced by CCSN)
//                                           Updated documentation
//                                       Changed default record specifications for logfiles BSE_DOUBLE_COMPACT_OBJECTS_REC and BSE_SUPERNOVAE_REC
//                                           Removed the individual SN_EVENT columns for both "Is" and "Experienced" conditions (e.g. CCSN, ECSN etc)
//                                           "Is*" and "Experienced*" columns replaced with SN_TYPE & Experienced_SN_TYPE columns that record the SN event type (e.g. CCSN, ECSN, PPSN, PPSIN, USSN).  
//                                           RUNAWAY, RECYCLED_NS, and RLOF_ONTO_NS are still reported in separate, individual columns.
//                                       Added workaround for non-existent CHeB blue loop.  See description in CHeB::CalculateTimescales()
//                                       Removed binary star "survived" flag - it is always the NOT of the "unbound" flag
//                                       Changed initialisation function for HeGB stars (HeGB::Initialise() in HeGB.h) to NOT recalculate m_Age if evolving from HeHG -> HeGB 
//                                       Removed initialisation of m_Age (to 0.0) from COWD::Initialise() in COWD.h
//                                   Changed behaviour:  
//                                       Changed binary star "disbound" flag to "unbound" flag.  Changed all occurences of "disbound" to "unbound".  Changed "unbound" header flag to "Unbound"
// 02.04.02      JR - Jan 06, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Added IsPISN() & IsPPISN() to IsSNEvent()
//                                       Fixed check for SN event at top of BaseBinaryStar::ResolveSupenova()
//                                       Changed BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateSupernovae() to more closely match legacy code behaviour (see notes in function description):
//                                          Added p_Calculate2ndSN parameter to determine if 2nd supernova needs to be resolved
//                                          Clear star2 current SN event if necessary
//                                          Check m_SemiMajorAxisPrime value prior to SN events (viz. new aPrime variable)
//                                       Fixed timestep initialisation in BaseStar::CalculateConvergedTimestepZetaNuclear()  (was negative)
//                                       Fixed m_Age calculation in FGB::ResolveEnvelopeLoss()
//                                       Added CalculateInitialSupernovaMass() to NS.h - was setting M = 5.0 for >= ONeWD, should be ONeWD only (introduced in fix in v04.02.00)
//                                       Changed NS functions to return Radius in Rsol instead of km:
//                                          Added function NS:CalculateRadiusOnPhaseInKM_Static() (returns radius in km)
//                                          Changed NS:CalculateRadiusOnPhase_Static() to return Rsol
//                                          Added CalculateRadiusOnPhase() for NS (ns.h) - returns Rsol 
//                                   Changed behaviour:  
//                                       Print detailed output record whenever stellartype changes (after star 2 if both change)
// (Unchanged)   LK - Jan 10, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Added missing includes to Star.cpp, utils.h and utils.cpp (required for some compiler versions)
// 02.05.00      JR - Jan 23, 2020 - New functionality:

// 02.05.06      JR - Mar 02, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                       - fixed m_MassesEquilibrated and associated functions - was erroneously typed as DOUBLE - now BOOL
//                                   Added/changed functionality:

//                                       - tidied up pythonSubmitDefault.py a little:
//                                             - set grid_filename = None (was '' which worked, but None is correct)
//                                             - set logfile_definitions = None (was '' which worked, but None is correct)
//                                             - added logfile names - set to None (COMPAS commandline arguments already exist for these - introduced in v02.00.00)
// 02.05.07      JR - Mar 08, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                       - fixed circularisation equation in BaseBinaryStar::InitialiseMassTransfer() - now takes new mass values into account

// 02.06.02      JR - Mar 15, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       - removed commented RLOF printing lines in constant.h (somehow that was lost in some out of sync git merges...)
//                                       - removed commented options no longer used from Options.h and Options.cpp
//                                       - fixed units headers in constants.h - there are now no blank units headers, so SPACE delimited files now parse ok (multiple spaces should be treated as a single space)
//                                       - changed file extention for TAB delimited files to 'tsv'
//                                       - removed "useImportanceSampling" option - not used in code
//                                       - fixed typo in zeta-calculation-every-timestep option in Options.cpp
//                                       - removed redundant OPTIONS->MassTransferCriticalMassRatioHeliumGiant() from qcritflag if statement in BaseBinaryStar::CalculateMassTransfer()
//                                       - fixed OPTIONS->FixedMetallicity() - always returned true, now returns actual value
//                                       - fixed OPTIONS->OutputPathString() - was always returning raw option instead of fully qualified path
//                                       - changed the following in BaseBinaryStar::SetRemainingCommonValues() - erroneously not ported from legacy code:
//                                           (a) m_JLoss = OPTIONS->MassTransferJloss();
//                                           (b) m_FractionAccreted = OPTIONS->MassTransferFractionAccreted();
//                                           (both were being set to default value of 0.0)
//                                       - added OPTIONS->ZetaAdiabaticArbitrary() - option existed, but Options code had no function to retrieve value
//                                       - added OPTIONS->MassTransferFractionAccreted() to options - erroneously not ported from legacy code
//                                   Changed functionality:
//                                       - all options now have default values, and those values will be displayed in the help text (rather than string constants which may be incorrect)
//                                       - boolean options can now be provided with an argument (e.g. --massTransfer false)
//                                       - added ProgramOptionDetails() to Options.cpp and OPTIONS->OptionsDetails() in preparation for change in output functionality
// 02.07.00      JR - Mar 16, 2020 - New/changed functionality:
//                                       - COMPAS Logfiles are created in a (newly created) directory - this way they are all kept together
//                                       - new command line option 'output-container' implemented (also in pythonSubmitDefault.py) - this option allows the user to specify the name of the log files container directory (default is 'COMPAS_Output')
//                                       - if detailed log files are created they will be created in a directory named 'Detailed_Output' within the container directory
//                                       - a run details file named 'Run_details' is created in the container directory.  The file records the run details:
//                                             - COMPAS version
//                                             - date & time of run
//                                             - timing details (wall time, CPU seconds)
//                                             - the command line options and parameters used:
//                                                   - the value of options and an indication of whether the option was supplied by the user or the default value was used
//                                                   - other parameters - calculated/determined - are recorded
//                                   Defect repair:
//                                       - changed "--outut" option name to "--outpuPath" in stringCommands in pythonSubmitDefault.py
// 02.08.00		  AVG - Mar 17, 2020 - Changed functionality:

//  									                   - removed tides code & associated pythonSubmitDefault.py options
//  									                   - removed deprecated options from pythonSubmitDefault.py options
//  									                   - renamed options: mass transfer, iterations -> timestep-iterations
//  									                   - commented AIS Options until fully implemented
// 02.08.01      JR - Mar 18, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - restored initialisation of AIS options in Options.cpp (AIS now defaults off instead of on)
//                                      - fixed retrieval of values for:
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_BOTTOM, 
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_MIDDLE, and 
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_TOP 
//                                         in BaseStar::StellarPropertyValue().  Were all previously retrieving same value as ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW
//                                      - fixed some comments in BAseBinaryStar.cpp (lines 2222 and 2468, "de Mink" -> "HURLEY")
//                                      - fixed description (in comments) of BinaryConstituentStar::SetPostCEEValues() (erroneously had "pre" instead of "post" - in comments only, not code)
//                                      - fixed description of BaseStar::DrawKickDirection()
// 02.08.02      JR - Mar 27, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - fixed issue #158 RocheLobe_1<CE == RocheLobe_2<CE always
//                                      - fixed issue #160 Circularisation timescale incorrectly calculated
//                                      - fixed issue #161 Splashscreen printed twice - now only prints once
//                                      - fixed issue #162 OPTIONS->UseFixedUK() always returns FALSE.  Now returns TRUE if user supplies a fixed kick velocity via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity command line option
// 02.08.03      JR - Mar 28, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - fixed typo in BaseBinaryStar::ResolveCommonEnvelopeEvent() when calculating circularisation timescale in the case where star2 is the donor: star1Copy was errorneously used instead of star2Copy; changed to star2Copy
//                                      - changed circularisation timescale of binary to be minimum of constituent stars circularisation timescales, clamped to (0.0, infinity)
// 02.09.00      JR - Mar 30, 2020 - Minor enhancements:
//                                      - tightened the conditions under which we allow over-contact binaries - enabling CHE is no longer a sufficient condition after this change: the allow-rlof-at-birth option must also be specified (ussue #164)
//                                      - added printing of number of stars (for SSE) or binaries (for BSE) created to both stdout and Run_Details (issue #165)
//                                      - enhanced grid processing code in main.cpp to better handle TAB characters
// 02.09.01      JR - Mar 30, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - OPTIONS->UseFixedUK() returns TRUE when user supplies -ve value via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity.  Now return TRUE iff the user supplies a value >=0 via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity
// 02.09.02      DC - Mar 30, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - Pulsar code fixed by correcting unit of NS radius in NS.cpp (added KM_TO_M constant in constants.h as a part of this),
//                                      correcting initialisation of pulsar birth parameters from GiantBranch.cpp to NS.cpp, adding an extra condition for isolated evolution when the companion loses mass but the NS does not accrete 
//                                      - option MACLEOD was printing wrongly as MACLEOD+2014 for user options, hence corrected it to MACLEOD in Options.cpp
// 02.09.03      JR - Apr 01, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - reinstated assignment of "prev" values in BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateBinary() (where call to ResolveTides() was removed).  Fixes low DNS count introduced in v02.08.00 caused by removal of ResolveTides() function (and call)
//                                      - commented option --logfile-BSE-be-binaries to match Be-Binary options commented by AVG in v02.08.00
// 02.09.04      JR - Apr 03, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - removed IsUSSN() from IsSNEvent() definition in BinaryConstituentStar.cpp (USSN flag indicates just US, not USSN. Needs to be tidied-up properly)
// 02.09.05	     IM - Apr 03, 2020 - Defect repair:
//  		                            - fixed timescale calculation issue for newly created HeHG stars (from stripped EAGB stars); fixes drop in CO core mass
// 02.09.06      JR - Apr 07, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - corrected calculation in return statement for Rand::Random(const double p_Lower, const double p_Upper) (issue #201)

//                                      - restored property names in COMPASUnorderedMap<STAR_PROPERTY, std::string> STAR_PROPERTY_LABEL in constants.h (issue #218) (was causing logfile definitions files to be parsed incorrectly)
// 02.09.10	     IM - Apr 12, 2020 - Minor enhancement: added Mueller & Mandel 2020 remnant mass and kick prescription, MULLERMANDEL
//  			                     Defect repair: corrected spelling of output help string for MULLER2016 and MULLER2016MAXWELLIAN
// 02.10.01	     IM - Apr 14, 2020 - Minor enhancement: 
//  				                            - moved code so that SSE will also sample SN kicks, following same code branch as BSE

// 02.10.05      JR - Apr 26, 2020 - Enhancements:
//                                      - Issue #239 - added actual random seed to Run_Details
//                                      - Issue #246 - changed Options.cpp to ignore --single-star-mass-max if --single-star-mass-steps = 1.  Already does in main.cpp.
// 02.10.06      JR - Apr 26, 2020 - Defect repair:

//                                      - Set He core mass to equal the CO core mass when the He shell is stripped (see issue #277)
//                                      - Ultra-stripped SNe are set at core collapse (do not confusingly refer to stripped stars as previously, see issue #189)

//                                      - Removed calculations of ZetaThermal and ZetaNuclear (these were previously incorrect because they relied on the evolution of a stellar copy which reverted to BaseStar and therefore didn't have the correct behaviour)
//                                      - Fixed CalculateZadiabatic to use ZetaAdiabaticArbitrary rather than ZetaThermalArbitrary; removed the latter
//                                      - Capped He core mass gain during shell H burning for CHeB and TPAGB stars, whose on-phase evolution now ends promptly when this limit is reached; this change also resolves issue #315 (higher mass SN remnants than total stellar mass)

//                                      - ONeWDs can now undergo ECSN if their mass rises above MECS=1.38 solar masses (previously, they could only undergo CCSN on rising above 1.38 solar masses).  ONeWD::CalculateInitialSupernovaMass now returns MCBUR1 rather than 5.0 to ensure this happens
//                                      - BaseStar::CalculateMaximumCoreMassSN() has been removed - it is superfluous since  GiantBranch::CalculateCoreMassAtSupernova_Static does the same thing
//                                      - Some misleading comments in TPAGB dealing with SNe have been clarified
//                                      - Option to set MCBUR1 [minimum core mass at base of the AGB to avoid fully degenerate CO core formation] to a value different from the Hurley default of 1.6 solar masses added, Issue #65 resolved
//                                      - Removed unused Options::SetToFiducialValues()

//                                      - changed call to (now) utils::SolveKeplersEquation() in BaseStar::CalculateSNAnomalies() to accept tuple with error and show error/warning as necessary
//                                      - removed call to std::cerr from utils::SolveQuadratic() - now returns error if equation has no real roots
//                                      - changed call to utils::SolveQuadratic() in GiantBranch::CalculateGravitationalRemnantMass() to accept tuple with error and show warning as necessary
//                                      - changed RadiusEqualsRocheLobeFunctor() in BinaryBaseStar.h to not use the SHOW_WARN macro (can't uset ObjectId() function inside a templated function - no object)
//                                      - changed COMMANDLINE_STATUS to PROGRAM_STATUS (better description)
//                                      - moved ERROR:NONE to top of enum in constants.h (so ERROR = 0 = NONE - makes more sense...)
//                                      - added new program option '--enable-warnings' to enable warning messages (via SHOW_WARN macros).  Default is false.  SHOW_WARN macros were previously #undefined
// 02.13.09     RTW - Aug 21, 2020  - Code cleanup:
// 									    - Created changelog.txt and moved content over from constants.h
// 									    - Changed OrbitalVelocity to OrbitalAngularVelocity where that parameter was misnamed
// 									    - Changed Pre/PostSNeOrbitalVelocity to OrbitalVelocityPre/PostSN for consistency
// 									    - Added and updated physical conversion constants for clarity (e.g MSOL to MSOL_TO_KG)
// 									    - Removed ID from output files, it is confusing and superceeded by SEED
// 									    - Removed 'Total' from TotalOrbital(Energy/AngularMomentum)

//                                      - Removed several stored options (e.g., m_OrbitalAngularVelocity, m_StarToRocheLobeRadiusRatio, etc.) to recompute them on an as-needed basis
//                                      - Removed some inf values in detailed outputs
//                                      - Slight speed-ups where feasible
//                                      - Shift various calculations to only be performed when needed, at printing, and give consistent values there (e.g., OmegaBreak, which was never updated previously)
//                                      - Remove a number of internal variables
//                                      - Declare functions constant where feasible
//                                      - Remove options to calculate Zetas and Lambdas at every timestep; variables that only appear in detailed outputs should not be computed at every timestep in a standard run
//                                      - Update documentation
//                                      - Remove postCEE binding energy (meaningless and wasn't re-computed, anyway)
// 02.13.12     IM - Aug 23, 2020   - Enhancement:
//                                      - More cleaning, removed some of the unnecessary prime quantities like m_SemiMajorAxisPrime, m_EccentricityPrime, etc.
//                                      - Thermal timescales are now correctly computed after the CE phase
//                                      - Detailed output passes a set of self-consistency checks (issue #288)

//                                      - Address issue #70 by stopping evolution if the binary is touching
//                                      - Check for merged binaries rather than just touching binaries in Evaluate
//                                      - Minor cleaning (e.g., removed unnecessary CheckMassTransfer, which just repeated the work of CalculateMassTransfer but with a confusing name)

//                                      - SSE Parameters files moved to "DETAILED_OUTPUT" folder (they are analogous to BSE_Detailed_Output files)
//                                      - implemented SSE Switch Log and BSE Switch Log files (record written at the time of stellar type switch - see documentation)
//                                      - implemented SSE Supernova log file - see documentation (issue #253)
//                                      - added TIMESCALE_MS as a valid property in BaseStar::StellarPropertyValue().  The TIMESCALE_MS value in the SSE_Parameters file was being printed as "ERROR!" and nobody noticed :-)  It now prints correctly.

//                                      - Removed unnecessary supernova phi rotation - it was added to agree with Simon's original definition, and to allow for seeds to reproduce the same SN final orbit. 
//                                      -   Removing it means seeds won't reproduce the same systems before and after, but populations are unaffected.

//
//                                      - 'CHE_Option' header string changed to 'CHE_Mode'.  A few typos fixed in header strings.

//                                          - records initial parameters and result (final stellar type) 
//                                          - useful when detailed output is not required
//                                      - Fix for Issue #439
//                                      - Fixed typo in LogfileSwitchLog() in Options.h - only affected situation where user specified switchlog filename (overriding default filename)
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseBinaryStar - never used in BSE code
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseStar - use OPTIONS->LuminousBlueVariableFactor()
//                                      - Removed m_WolfRayetFactor variable from BaseBinaryStar - never used in BSE code
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseStar - use OPTIONS->WolfRayetFactor()
// 02.17.01     RTW - Nov 10, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added in Schneider 2020 remnant mass prescriptions (standard and alternative)
//                                      - Added parameter MassTransferDonorHistory, as required for above prescription, which tracks the MT donor type (from which the MT Case can be established)
// 02.17.02     RTW - Nov 13, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Cleaned up the demo plotting routine so that the plot produced is the plot we use in the methods paper
// 02.17.03     JR - Nov 13, 2020   - Enhancements, code cleanup
//                                      - Added metallicity-distribution option: available distributions are ZSOLAR and LOGUNIFORM (see documentation)
//                                          - Added metallicity-min and metallicity-max options (for metallicity-distribution option)
//                                          - Metallicity is sampled if not explicitly specified via the --metallicity option - this was existing functionality, but
//                                            no distribution was implemented: sampling always returned ZSOLAR.  This change adds the LOGUNIFORM distribution, and 'formalises' the ZSOLAR 'distribution'.
//                                      - Added MASS to default SSE_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS_REC
//                                      - Removed AIS code
//                                      - Removed variable 'alpha' from BinaryCEDetails struct - use OPTIONS->CommonEnvelopeAlpha()
//                                          - Removed BINARY_PROPERTY::COMMON_ENVELOPE_ALPHA - use PROGRAM_OPTION::COMMON_ENVELOPE_ALPHA
//                                      - Issue #443: removed eccentricity distribution options FIXED, IMPORTANCE & THERMALISE (THERMALISE = THERMAL, which remains) 
// 02.17.04     JR - Nov 14, 2020   - Defect repairs
//                                      - Added CalculateRadiusOnPhase() and CalculateLuminosityOnPhase() to class BH (increases DNS yield)
//                                      - Added metallicity to sampling conditions in BaseBinaryStar constructor (should have been done when LOGUNIFORM metallicity distribution added)
// 02.17.05     TW - Nov 16, 2020   - Defect repairs
//                                      - Issue #444
//                                          - Fixed typo in synchronisation timescale

//                                      - Issue #431
//                                          - Added option to change LBV wind prescription: choices are NONE, HURLEY_ADD, HURLEY and BELCYZNSKI
//                                      - Replaced numbers with constants for luminosity and temperature limits in mass loss
//                                      - Consolidated checks of luminosity for NJ winds within function
//                                      - NOTE: the above makes sure luminosity is checked before applying NJ winds for MS stars, this was not previously the case but I think it should be
// 02.17.08     JR - Nov 19, 2020   - Enhancements, code cleanup
//                                      - Added orbital-period-distribution option (see note in Options.cpp re orbital period option)
//                                      - Added mass-ratio option
//                                      - Updated default pythonSubmit to reflect new options, plus some previous omissions (by me...)
//                                      - Minor typo/formatting changes throughout
//                                      - Updated docs for new options, plus some typos/fixes/previous omissions
// 02.17.09     RTW - Nov 20, 2020  - Bug fix:
//                                      - Removed corner case for MT_hist=8 stars in the Schneider prescription (these should be considered Ultra-stripped)
// 02.17.10     RTW - Nov 25, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Cleaned up Schneider remnant mass function (now uses PPOW), and set the HeCore mass as an upper limit to the remnant mass
// 02.17.11     LVS - Nov 27, 2020  - Enhancements:
//                                      - Added option to vary all winds with OverallWindMassLossMultiplier
// 02.17.12     TW - Dec 9, 2020    - Enhancement, code cleanup, bug fix
//                                      - Issue #463
//                                          - Changed variable names from dml, dms etc. to rate_XX where XX is the mass loss recipe
//                                          - No longer overwrite variables with next mass loss recipe for clarity
//                                      - Added a new option to check the photon tiring limit during mass loss (default false for now)
//                                      - Added a new class variable to track the dominant mass loss rate at each timestep
// 02.17.13     JR - Dec 11, 2020   - Defect repair
//                                      - uncomment initialisations of mass transfer critical mass ratios in Options.cpp (erroneously commented in v02.16.00)
// 02.17.14     TW - Dec 16, 2020   - Bug fix
//                                      - fix behaviour at fLBV=0 (had been including other winds but should just ignore them)
// 02.17.15     JR - Dec 17, 2020   - Code and architecture cleanup
//                                      - Architecture changes:
//                                          - Added Remnants class    - inherits from HeGB class
//                                          - Added WhiteDwarfs class - inherits from Remnants class; most of the WD code moved from HeWD, COWD and ONeWD to WhiteDwarfs class
//                                          - Changed HeWD class      - inherits from WhiteDwarfs class (COWD still inherits from HeWD; ONeWD from COWD)
//                                          - Change NS class         - inherits from Remnants class; code added/moved as necessary
//                                          - Change BH class         - inherits from Remnants class; code added/moved as necessary
//                                          - Change MR class         - inherits from Remnants class; code added/moved as necessary
//                                      - Code cleanup:
//                                          - added "const" to many functions (mostly SSE code) that dont modify class variables ("this") (still much to do, but this is a start)
//                                          - added "virtual" to GiantBranch::CalculateCoreMassAtBAGB() and BaseStar::CalculateTemperatureAtPhaseEnd()
//                                              - will have no impact given where they are called, but the keyword should be there (in case of future changes)
//                                          - changed hard-coded header suffixes from _1 -> (1), _2 -> (2)
//                                      - Added call to main() to seed random number generator with seed = 0 before options are processed (and user specified seed is know).  Ensures repeatability.
//                                      - Changed "timestep below minimum" warnings in Star.cpp to be displayed only if --enable-warnings is specified
// 02.17.16     JR - Dec 17, 2020   - Code cleanup
//                                      - Removed "virtual" from GiantBranch::CalculateCoreMassAtBAGB() (incorrectly added in v02.17.15 - I was right the first time)
//                                      - Removed "const" from Remnants::ResolveMassLoss() (inadvertently added in v02.17.15)
//                                      - Removed declarations of variables m_ReducedMass, m_ReducedMassPrev, m_TotalMass, and m_TotalMassPrevfrom BaseBinaryStar.h (cleanup begun in v02.15.10 - these declarations were missed)
// 02.17.17     RTW - Dec 17, 2020  - Code cleanup
//                                      - Removed MassTransferCase related variables in favor of MassTransferDonorHist
// 02.17.18     JR - Dec 18, 2020   - Defect repair
//                                      - Typo in options code for option --switch-log: "switchlog" was incorrectly used instead of "switch-log"
// 02.17.19     LVS - Dec 19, 2020  - Enhancements:
//                                      - Added option to vary winds of cool stars (with T < VINK_MASS_LOSS_MINIMUM_TEMP) via a CoolWindMassLossMultiplier
// 02.18.00     JR - Jan 08, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added support for HDF5 logfiles (see notes at top of log.h)
//                                      - Added 'logfile-type' option; allowed values are HDF5, CSV, TSV, TXT; default is HDF5
//                                      - Added 'hdf5-chunk-size' option - specifies the HDF5 chunk size (number of dataset entries)
//                                      - Added 'hdf5-buffer-size' option - specifies the HDF5 IO buffer size (number of chunks)
//                                      - Removed 'logfile-delimiter' option - delimiter now set by logfile type (--logfile-type option described above)
//                                      - Changed header strings containing '/' character: '/' replaced by '|' (header strings become dataset names in HDF5 files, and '/' is a path delimiter...)
// 02.18.01     SS - Jan 11, 2021   - Defect repair
//                                      - Added check if binary is bound when evolving unbound binaries
// 02.18.02     JR - Jan 12, 2021   - Defect repair:
//                                      - Changed "hdf5_chunk_size = 5000" to "hdf5_chunk_size = 100000" in default pythonSubmit (inadvertently left at 5000 after some tests...)
// 02.18.03     SS - Jan 19, 2021   - Enhancement:
// 									    - Added check for neutron star mass against maximum neutron star mass. 
//									      If a neutron star exceeds this mass it should collapse to a black hole. 
//                                        This can be relevant for neutron stars accreting, e.g. during common envelope evolution
// 02.18.04     IM - Jan 28, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - NS to BH collapse preserves mass (see discussion in #514)
//                                      - Fixed comment typo
// 02.18.05     JR - Jan 29, 2021   - Defect repair:
//                                      - Honour '--evolve-unbound-systems' option when specified in a grid file (see issue #519)
//                                      - Honour '--evolve-pulsars' option when specified in a grid file (same as issue #519)
//                                      - Added "maximum-evolution-time", "maximum-number-timestep-iterations", and "timestep-multiplier" to m_GridLineExcluded vector in Options.h (previous oversight)
// 02.18.06     SS - Feb 1, 2021    - Defect repair:
//                                      - Make COMPAS use --neutrino-mass-loss-BH-formation options (resolves issue #453)
// 02.18.07     JR - Feb 18, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added 'rotational-frequency' option so users can specify initial rotational frequency of SSE star
//                                      - Added 'rotational-frequency-1' and 'rotational-frequency-2' options so users can specify initial rotational frequency of both BSE stars
//                                      - Changed units of rotational frequencies written to logfiles (omega, omega_break, omega_ZAMS) from rotations per year to Hz
//                                      - Changed program option header strings containing '_1' and '_2' to '(1)' and '(2)' for consistency
// 02.18.08     JR - Feb 26, 2021   - Defect repairs:
//                                      - Remove stray diagnostic print from BaseStar constructor in BaseStar.cpp
//                                      - Fix for issue #530 - some commandline options ignored when a grid file is used
//                                          - the issue here was case-sensitive vs case-insensitive matches (asking BOOST to do case-insensitive matches for option names doesn't propagate to all matches BOOST does...)
//                                          - the options affected were all options that have mixed-case names:
//
//                                              - case-BB-stability-prescription
//                                              - kick-magnitude-sigma-CCSN-BH

//                                              - PPI-upper-limit
// 02.18.09     ML - Mar 22, 2021   - Defect repair:
//                                      - Correct polynomial evaluation of Nanjing lambda's for EAGB and TPAGB stellar types.
// 02.18.10     LVS - Apr 06, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added PPISN prescription option - Farmer 2019
// 02.19.00     JR - Apr 20, 2021   - Enhancements and Defect Repairs:
//                                      - Enhancements:
//                                          - Added option to enable users to add program options values to BSE/SSE system parameters files
//                                              - option is '--add-options-to-sysparms', allowed values are {ALWAYS, GRID, NEVER}.  See docs for details.
//                                          - Included "Run_Details" file in HDF5 output file if logfile type = HDF5.  The text Run_Details file still exists
//                                            so users can still easily look at the contents of the Run_Details file - this enhancements adds a copy of the
//                                            Run_Details file to the HDF5 output file.
//
//                                      - Defect Repairs:
//                                          - fixed a few previously unnoticed typos in PROGRAM_OPTION map in constamts.h, and in Options::OptionValue() function.
//                                            Fairly benign since they had't been noticed, but needed to be fixed.

//                                      Modified h5copy.py (in postProcessing/Folders/H5/PythonScripts) so that groups (COMPAS files) will not be copied
//                                      if the group exists in the destination file but has a different number of datasets (columns) from the group in
//                                      the source file.
//
//                                      Also provided h5view.py - an HDF5 file viewer for COMPAS HDF5 files (in postProcessing/Folders/H5/PythonScripts).  See
//                                      documentation as top of source file for details.
// 02.19.01     JR - Apr 30, 2021   - Enhancements and Defect Repairs:
//                                      - Enhancements:
//                                          - changed chunk size for HDF5 files to HDF5_MINIMUM_CHUNK_SIZE for Run_Details group in COMPAS_Output and for detailed output files.
//                                              - Run_Details is a small file, and detailed output files are generally a few thousand records rather than hundreds of thousands, 
//                                                so a smaller chunk size wastes less space and doesn't impact performance significantly
//
//                                      - Defect Repairs:
//                                          - fixed issue #548 - HDF5 detailed output files not created when random-seed specified in a grid file
//                                          - fixed defect where records in HDF5 output files would be duplicated if the number of systems exceeded the HDF5 chunck size
//                                            being used (the default chunk size is 100000 - that might explain why this problem hasn't been reported)
//
//                                      Modified h5view.py (in postProcessing/Folders/H5/PythonScripts) to handle detailed ouput files
// 02.19.02     LVS - May 04, 2021   - Defect Repairs:
//                                      - Avoid possibility of exceeding total mass in Farmer PPISN prescription
// 02.19.03     TW - May 18, 2021    - Enhancement:
//                                      - Change default LBV wind prescription to HURLEY_ADD
// 02.19.04     JR - May 24, 2021    - Defect Repair:
//                                      - Fixed incrementing of random seed and binary id when grid file contains sets/ranges
//
//                                      Modified h5view.py (in postProcessing/Folders/H5/PythonScripts) to print number of unique seeds (where relevant) in summary output
// 02.20.00     IM - June 14, 2021  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Port defaults from preProcessing/pythonSubmit.py to options.cpp
//                                      - Minor fixes (e.g., documentation)
// 02.20.01     JR - June 21, 2021  - Defect repair:
//                                      - Fix for issue #585: add formatted value and delimiter to logrecord string in Log.h (defect introduced in v02.18.00; only affected SSE_Supernovae logfile)
// 02.20.02     JR - July 26, 2021  - Defect repair:
//                                      - Add HDF5 support to logging code for SSE/BSE switch log files.  Support for HDF5 switch files was inadvertently not added when HDF5 file support as added in v02.18.00 for all standard log files.  Switch log files are 'special' (they have extra columns, not part of the 'standard' log file functionality), and that was missed.
//                                      - Also removed '-lsz' from Makefile and Makefile.docker - library not required
// 02.21.00     JR - July 28, 2021  - Enhancement and Defect Repairs:
//                                      - Added code to copy any grid file and/or logfile-definitions file specified to output container.
//                                      - Copying a large grid file could take time, and take up much space, so added new program option '--store-input-files' which is TRUE by default.  If FALSE, neither the grid file (if specified) nor the logfile-definitions file (if specified) will be copied to the output container (if TRUE, both will be copied (if specified)).
//                                      - Fixed issue #600: changed pythonSubmit.py to treat fully-qualified grid filenames and fully-qualified logfile-definitions filenames correctly (i.e. don't add CWD if the filename is already fully-qualified).
//                                      - Fixed issue #601: changed pythonSubmit.py to put all boolean parameters on the commandline, with "True" or "False" value.
// 02.21.01     RTW - Aug 21, 2021  - Defect Repair:
//                                      - PrintRLOFProperties now gets called immediately before and after the call to EvaluateBinary so that the changes reflect only BSE changes.
//                                      - The function call has also been tidied up to take an argument specifying whether the call was made before or after the MT took place.
// 02.22.00     JR - Aug 26, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added functionality to allow users to select a range of lines from the grid file (if specified) to process.  Added program options --grid-start-line and --grid-lines-to-process - see documentation for details.
// 02.22.01     JR - Sep 11, 2021   - Defect repair:
//                                      - Fix for issue #615: defaults for calculated/drawn program options now calculated after random seed is set for the system being evolved.
// 02.22.02     IM - Oct 4, 2021    - Defecr repair:
//                                      - Removed unnecessary IsPrimary() / BecomePrimary() functionality, fixed incorrect MassTransferTrackerHistory (see issue #605)
// 02.22.03     IM - Oct 4, 2022    - Defect repair:
//                                      - Corrected Eddington mass accretion limits, issue #612 (very minor change for WDs and NSs, factor of a few increase for BHs)
// 02.23.00 FSB/JR - Oct 11, 2021   - Enhancement:
//                                      - updated kelvin-helmholtz (thermal) timescale calculation with more accurate pre-factor and updated documentation.
//                                      - rationalised parameters of, and calls to, CalculateThermalTimescale()
// 02.23.01     JR - Oct 11, 2021   - Code cleanup:
//                                      - Typo fixed in version for changes made on October 11, 2021
//                                      - Changed KROUPA_POWER to SALPETER_POWER in utils:SampleInitialMass(); Removed KROUPA_POWER from constants.h
//                                      - Removed p_Id parameter from SSE/BSE switchlog functions - leftover from debugging
//                                      - Added CHEMICALLY_HOMOGENEOUS_MAIN_SEQUENCE property to SSE_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS_REC and BSE_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS_REC (both stars)
//                                      - Tidied up some parameters etc. to better comply with COMPAS coding guidelines
//                                      - Typo fixed in preProcessing/COMPAS_Output_Definitions.txt
// 02.24.00     JR - Oct 12, 2021   - Minor enhancements/optimisations:
//                                      - Added BaseStar::CalculateThermalMassAcceptanceRate() as a first-pass to address issue #595 - can be changed/expanded as required
//                                      - Changed BaseBinaryStar::CalculateTimeToCoalescence() to use Mandel 2021 https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ac2d35, eq 5 to address issue #538
// 02.24.01     RTW - Oct 13, 2021  - Enhancements:
//                                      - Added units uniformly to the --help input descriptions
//                                      - Removed the BeBinary- and RLOF-specific random seeds (which were attributes of the events and were printed with e.g <MT) and replaced with system random seed
//                                      - In CE output, changed MASS_2_FINAL (which was sort of a wrapper for core mass) for MASS_2_POST_COMMON_ENVELOPE
//                                      - Removed SN kick angles from SystemParameters output (they are duplicated in SN output) and changed true_anomaly to mean_anomaly in BSE SN output
//                                      - Cosmetic typo fixes and added consistency, in the Event_Counter parameters and some function definitions
//                                      - Added *.eps, *.png to gitignore
// 02.24.02     JR - Oct 13, 2021   - Minor fixes:
//                                      - Fixed a few typos in header strings
//                                      - Changed true_anomaly to mean_anomaly in SSE SN output
// 02.25.00     JR - Oct 30, 2021   - Enhancements and minor fixes:
//                                      - Added ability for users to annotate log files via new program options '--notes-hdrs' and '--notes'.  See docs for details. 
//                                      - Added a shorthand notation for vector program options (e.g. annotations, log-classes, debug-classes).  See docs for details.
//                                      - Added '--notes-hdrs' and '--notes' to pythonSubmit.py (default = None for both)
//                                      - Added HDF5 support to Log::GetLogStandardRecord() (return value) and Log::LogStandardRecord() (input parameter).  This only matters
//                                        to SSE Supernovae file - for delayed writes.  The original implementation may have resulted in minor discrepanicies in SSE Supernovae
//                                        log records, (because of when the values were sampled (i.e. mid-timestep, or end of timestep)), which would only have been evident if
//                                        HDF5 files were compared to e.g. CSV files for the same binary - CSV, TSV, and TXT files had values sampled mid-timestep, HDF5 files 
//                                        at end of timestep).
//                                      - Added Log::Write() and Log::Put() for HDF5 files (better implementation - worked around in original implementation)
//                                      - Added additional checks for bad string -> number conversions throughout (for stoi(), stod(), etc.)
//                                      - Performance enhancement to BaseBinaryStar::CalculateTimeToCoalescence() (return early if e = 0.0)
//                                      - Fixed a few typos in comments
// 02.25.01     IM - Nov 1, 2021    -  Enhancements:

//                                      - fixed typo in Options.cpp for option --common-envelope-allow-radiative-envelope-survive (was typed common-envelope-allow-radiative-envelope-surive)
//                                        (neither of these caused problems because Boost matches only as many characters as necessary to determine the option name - would have if the names were not unique up to the typos)
// 02.25.04     IM - Nov 4, 2021     - Minor fixes
//                                      - More surive->survive typo fixes in python files to address issue #660
//                                      - Documentation edits to reflect new options common-envelope-allow-radiative-envelope-survive and common-envelope-allow-immediate-rlof-post-ce-survive options
// 02.25.05     IM - Nov 4, 2021     - Defect repair:
//                                      - Changed GiantBranch::CalculateRemnantMassByMullerMandel() to ensure that the remnant mass is no greater than the He core mass

// 02.25.07     IM - Nov 12, 2021    - Defect repair:
//                                      - Changed EAGB::CalculateLuminosityOnPhase() and EAGB::CalculateLuminosityAtPhaseEnd() to use the helium core mass rather than the CO core mass (see Eq. in second paragraph of section 5.4 of Hurley+, 2000); this fixes a downward step in luminosity and radius on transition to EAGB
// 02.25.08     JR - Nov 15, 2021    - Defect repair:
//                                      - Fixed error introduced in v02.25.00: Added HDF5 support to GetLogStandardRecord().
//                                        Defect introduced was omission of code for HDF5 file support if a specified property is supplied to GetLogStandardRecord(), causing a boost::bad_get error.
//                                        The defect only affected HDF5 SSE_Supernovae files.  This fix adds the omitted code.
//                                      - Changed Options::PrintOptionHelp() to print help (-h/--h) to stdout instead of stderr.
// 02.25.09     IM - Nov 16, 2021    - Defect repair:

// 02.26.00     IM - Nov 30, 2021    - Defect repairs:
//                                      - only decrease effective initial mass for HG and HeHG stars on mass loss when this decrease would not drive an unphysical decrease in the core mass
//                                      - change mass comparisons (e.g., mass vs. He flash mass threshold) to compare effective initial mass rather than current mass
//                                      - minor code and comment cleanup
// 02.26.01     IM - Dec 5, 2021     - Defect repair, Code cleanup:

//                                      - Add function HasOnlyOneOf, which returns true if a binary has only one component in the list of stellar types passed, and false if neither or both are in the list
//                                      - Add function IsHMXRBinary, which returns true if HasOnlyOneOf(Black hole, Neutron star) and the companion radius is > 80% of the Roche Lobe radius
//                                      - Add flag --hmxr-binaries, which tells COMPAS to store binaries in BSE_RLOF output file if IsHMXRBinary
//                                      - Add columns for pre- and post-timestep ratio of stars to Roche Lobe radius to BSE_RLOF output file (addressing issue #746)

// 02.27.08     RTW - Apr 12, 2022   - Defect repair:
//                                      - Fix for issue # 783 - Some mergers involving a massive star were not logged properly in BSE_RLOF, whenever a jump in radius due to changing stellar type within ResolveMassChanges was much greater than the separation.
// 02.27.09     VK - Apr 25, 2022    - Minor Enhancement:

//                                        Only caused a problem if a user wanted to add either of those to the logfile-definitions file - but since they are in the system parameters files (SSE and BSE)
//                                        by default encountering the problem would probably be unlikely.
//                                      - Fixed error identifier in Log::UpdateAllLogfileRecordSpecs() - was (incorrectly) ERROR::UNKNOWN_BINARY_PROPERTY, now (correctly) ERROR::UNKNOWN_STELLAR_PROPERTY

//                                      - Updated the relevant section in the detailed plotter that uses MT_TRACKER values
//                                      - Removed end states from detailed plotter (Merger, DCO, Unbound) so that they don't over compress the rest
// 02.31.05     RTW - July 25, 2022  - Defect repair:
//                                      - Renamed option '--allow-H-rich-ECSN' to 'allow-non-stripped-ECSN'
//                                      - Fixed check for non-interacting ECSN progenitors to consider MT history instead of H-richness
// 02.31.06     RTW - Aug 2, 2022    - Enhancement:

//                                      - Add new option for each standard log file to allow specification of which record types to print
//                                          - see e.g. '--logfile-detailed-output-record-types'
