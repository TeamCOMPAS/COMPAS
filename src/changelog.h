// 02.02.02      JR - Oct 07, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       SSE iteration (increment index - Grids worked, range of values wasn't incrementing)
//                                       Errors service (FIRST_IN_FUNCTION errors sometimes printed every time)
//                                       Added code for both SSE and BSE so that specified metallicities be clamped to [0.0, 1.0].  What are reasonable limits?
//                                   Errors service performance enhancement (clean deleted stellar objects from catalog)
//                                   Changed way binary constituent stars masses equilibrated (they now retain their ZAMS mass, but (initial) mass and mass0 changes)
//                                   Add initial stellar type variable - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added change history and version number to constants.h
// 02.02.03      JR - Oct 09, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Initialised all BaseStar.m_Supernova elements (some had not been initialised)
//                                       Fixed regression in BaseStar.cpp (INITIAL_STELLAR_TYPE & INITIAL_STELLAR_TYPE_NAME in StellarPropertyValue())
//                                   Added max iteration check to Newton-Raphson method in SolveKeplersEquation (see constant MAX_KEPLER_ITERATIONS)
// 02.02.04      JR - Oct 09, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       SN kick direction calculation corrected

// 02.02.05      JR - Oct 10, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Determination of Chemically Homogeneous star fixed (threshold calculation)
//                                       Removed checks for RLOF to/from CH stars
//                                       Typos fixed
// 02.02.06      JR - Oct 11, 2019 - Renamed class "CHE" - now class "CH"
//                                   Updated CHE documentation
//                                   Added m_MassesEquilibrated variable to BaseBinaryStar
// 02.02.07      JR - Oct 20, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       CEE printing systems post-stripping - github issue - reworked CE details/pre/post CE - partial fix (BindingEnergy remaining)
//                                       Added RANDOM_SEED to Options::OptionValue() (omitted erroneously)
//                                   Added m_SecondaryTooSmallForDCO variable to BaseBinaryStar - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added m_StellarMergerAtBirth variable to BaseBinaryStar - and to some record definitions
//                                   Added allow-rlof-at-birth program option
//                                       If CHE enabled, or allow-rlof-at-birth option is true, binaries that have one or both stars
//                                       in RLOF at birth will have masses equilibrated, radii recalculated, orbit circularised, and
//                                       semi-major axis recalculated, while conserving angular momentum - then allowed to evolve
//                                   Added allow-touching-at-birth program option
//                                       Binaries that have stars touching at birth (check is done after any equilibration and
//                                       recalculation of radius and separation is done) are allowed to evolve.  Evolve() function
//                                       immediately checks for merger at birth, flags status as such and stops evolution.
//                                   Documentation updated (see updated doc for detailed explanation of new program options)
// 02.03.00      JR - Oct 25, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       removed extraneous delimiter at end of log file records
//                                   Added '--version' option
//                                   Changed minor version number - should have been done at last release - we'll grant the '--version' option minor release status...
// 02.03.01      JR - Nov 04, 2019 - Defect repair:
//                                       removed erroneous initialisation of m_CEDetails.alpha from BaseBinaryStar::SetRemainingCommonValues()
//                                       (CE Alpha was alwas being initialised to 0.0 regardless of program options)
// 02.03.02      JR - Nov 25, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       added check for active log file before closing in Log::Stop()
//                                       added CH stars to MAIN_SEQUENCE and ALL_MAIN_SEQUENCE initializer_lists defined in constants.h
//                                       moved InitialiseMassTransfer() outside 'if' - now called even if not using mass transfer - sets some flags we might need
//                                       added code to recalculate rlof if CH stars are equilibrated in BaseBinaryStar constructor
//                                   Enhancements:
//                                       moved KROUPA constants from AIS class to constants.h
//                                       moved CalculateCDFKroupa() function from AIS class to BaseBinaryStar class
//                                       added m_CHE variable to BaseStar class - also selectable for printing
//                                       added explicit check to ResolveCommonEnvelope() to merge binary if the donor is a main sequence star
//                                   Chemically Homogeneous Evolution changes:
//                                       added check to CheckMassTransfer() in BaseBinaryStar.cpp to merge if CH+CH and touching - avoid CEE
//                                       added code to InitialiseMassTransfer() in BaseBinaryStar.cpp to equilibrate and possibly merge if both CH stars in RLOF
// (Unchanged)   IM - Nov 29, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       changed Disbound -> Unbounded in header strings in constants.h
//                                       left one line in default/example grid file (Grid.txt)
//                                       fix default PPISN mass limit in python submit: 65 Msol -> 60 Msol
// 02.03.03      JR - Dec 04, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       added code to UpdateAttributesAndAgeOneTimestep() in Star.cpp to recalculate stellar attributes after switching to new stellar type
//                                       (addresses discontinuous transitions e.g. CH -> HeMS)
//                                       changed IsPulsationalPairInstabilitySN() in GiantBranch.cpp to call IsPairInstabilitySN() instead of set MASSLESS_REMNANT if remnant mass <= 0.0
//                                       changed CalculateSNKickVelocity() in BaseStar.cpp to set m_SupernovaDetails.kickVelocity correctly after adjusting for fallback
// 02.03.04      FSB - Dec 04, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       fixed bug in Fryer+2012 CalculateGravitationalRemnantMassadded() function to compare baryon mass of star remnant with
//  									                   baryon mass of MaximumNeutronStarMass instead of just MaximumNeutronStarMass. 
//                                       added m_BaryonicMassOfMaximumNeutronStarMass to BaseStar.h and BaseStar.cpp
// 02.03.05      JR - Dec 05, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       fixed EvolveSingleStars() in main.cpp to print correct initial mass
//                                       fixed TPAGB::CalculateCOCoreMassAtPhaseEnd() - added conditional
// 02.04.00      JR - Dec 18, 2019 - New functionality:
//                                       added columns to BSE grid functionality: Kick_Velocity_1(&2), Kick_Theta_1(&2), Kick_Phi_1(&2), Kick_Mean_Anomaly_1(&2).  Updated documentation.
//                                   Changed functionality:
//                                       removed compiler version checks from Makefile - they seemed to only work for native Ubuntu and were more of a nuisance than anything...  (old version exists as Makefile-checks)
//                                   Defect repairs:
//                                       added recalculation of gbParams Mx & Lx in HeHG calculateGbParams()
//                                       created HeHG::CalculateGBParams_Static() and GiantBranch::CalculateGBParams_Static(), called from EAGB::ResolveEnvelopeLoss() to facilitate calculation of attributes for new stellar type before actually switching.  Needed to rewrite some other functions as static.  Note: this needs to be revisited and a more elegant solution implemented.
//                                       added CalculateRadiusAndStellarTypeOnPhase() for HeHG and HeGBstars, and changed call to calculateRadiusOnPhase() to CalculateRadiusAndStellarTypeOnPhase() in BaseStar::EvolveOnPhase().  This allows for HeHG and HeGB stars to change stellar type based on radius (previously missed).
//                                       set M = McBAGB for EAGB & TPAGB only (was being set for all types >= TPAGB)
//                                       added extra print detailed in BaseBinaryStar:Evolve() - sometimes missing a switch type in detailed output if only 1 timestep
//                                       swapped heading strings for ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::IS_ECSN and ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::IS_USSN (now correct)
//                                       removed condition in BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateSupernovae().  ResolveSupernova() is now called for all stellar types (not sure what I was thinking orginally. I'm sure I had a good reason - or maybe I was just tired...)
//                                       changed name of GiantBranch::CalculateProtoCoreMass() to GiantBranch::CalculateProtoCoreMassDelayed() and changed calls to the function
//                                       swapped order of calculations of ePrime (CalculateOrbitalEccentricityPostSupernova()) and m_SemiMajorAxisPrime (CalculateSemiMajorAxisPostSupernova()) in BaseBinaryStar::ResolveSupernova().  Improper order was causing wrong value of m_SeminMajorAxisPrime to be used in calculation of ePrime
//                                       set m_Disbound = true appropriately in BaseBinaryStar::Evolve() (note: m_Disbound will change name to m_Unbound soon...)
//                                       changed return value of CHeB::DetermineEnvelopeType() to CONVECTIVE.  Left CHeB DetermineEnvelopeTypeHurley2002() as RADIATIVE (used in BinaryConstituentStar::CalculateSynchronisationTimescale())
//                                       changed BINARY_PROPERTY::ORBITAL_VELOCITY to BINARY_PROPERTY::ORBITAL_VELOCITY_PRE_2ND_SUPERNOVA in BSE_SUPERNOVAE_REC (6th value printed)
//                                       added p_Erase parameter to Log::CloseStandardFile(); changed Log::CloseAllStandardFiles() to call Log::CloseStandardFile() with p_Erase=false and erase entire map after all files closed (prevent coredump when closing all files)
//                                       added ResolveSupernova() to ONeWD.h - ONeWD stars were previously not checking for SN
//                                       fixed BaseBinaryStar::InitialiseMassTransfer() - star1 was being updated instead of star2 for CH + CH stars when CHE enabled
// 02.04.01      JR - Dec 23, 2019 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Removed SN_EVENT::SN - all occurences of SN_EVENT::SN replaced by SN_EVENT::CCSN.
//                                           The current SN event ("Is"), and past SN event ("Experienced") are now bit maps (implemented as Enum Classes).  Each can have any of the values: CCSN, ECSN, PISN, PPSIN, USSN, RUNAWAY, RECYCLED_NS, and RLOF_ONTO_NS.  See definition of SN_EVENT Enum Class in constants.h for implementation and explanation.  
//                                       Updated variables selectable for printing:
//                                           Added ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::SN_TYPE (STAR_PROPERTY, SUPERNOVA_PROPERTY, COMPANION_PROPERTY (should always be SN_EVENT::NONE for companion star))
//                                           Added ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::EXPERIENCED_SN_TYPE (STAR_PROPERTY, SUPERNOVA_PROPERTY, COMPANION_PROPERTY)
//                                           All of ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::{CCSN, ECSN, PISN, PPISN, USSN} now selectable
//                                           Removed ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::SN - no longer selectable for printing (replaced by CCSN)
//                                           Updated documentation
//                                       Changed default record specifications for logfiles BSE_DOUBLE_COMPACT_OBJECTS_REC and BSE_SUPERNOVAE_REC
//                                           Removed the individual SN_EVENT columns for both "Is" and "Experienced" conditions (e.g. CCSN, ECSN etc)
//                                           "Is*" and "Experienced*" columns replaced with SN_TYPE & Experienced_SN_TYPE columns that record the SN event type (e.g. CCSN, ECSN, PPSN, PPSIN, USSN).  
//                                           RUNAWAY, RECYCLED_NS, and RLOF_ONTO_NS are still reported in separate, individual columns.
//                                       Added workaround for non-existent CHeB blue loop.  See description in CHeB::CalculateTimescales()
//                                       Removed binary star "survived" flag - it is always the NOT of the "unbound" flag
//                                       Changed initialisation function for HeGB stars (HeGB::Initialise() in HeGB.h) to NOT recalculate m_Age if evolving from HeHG -> HeGB 
//                                       Removed initialisation of m_Age (to 0.0) from COWD::Initialise() in COWD.h
//                                   Changed behaviour:  
//                                       Changed binary star "disbound" flag to "unbound" flag.  Changed all occurences of "disbound" to "unbound".  Changed "unbound" header flag to "Unbound"
// 02.04.02      JR - Jan 06, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Added IsPISN() & IsPPISN() to IsSNEvent()
//                                       Fixed check for SN event at top of BaseBinaryStar::ResolveSupenova()
//                                       Changed BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateSupernovae() to more closely match legacy code behaviour (see notes in function description):
//                                          Added p_Calculate2ndSN parameter to determine if 2nd supernova needs to be resolved
//                                          Clear star2 current SN event if necessary
//                                          Check m_SemiMajorAxisPrime value prior to SN events (viz. new aPrime variable)
//                                       Fixed timestep initialisation in BaseStar::CalculateConvergedTimestepZetaNuclear()  (was negative)
//                                       Fixed m_Age calculation in FGB::ResolveEnvelopeLoss()
//                                       Added CalculateInitialSupernovaMass() to NS.h - was setting M = 5.0 for >= ONeWD, should be ONeWD only (introduced in fix in v04.02.00)
//                                       Changed NS functions to return Radius in Rsol instead of km:
//                                          Added function NS:CalculateRadiusOnPhaseInKM_Static() (returns radius in km)
//                                          Changed NS:CalculateRadiusOnPhase_Static() to return Rsol
//                                          Added CalculateRadiusOnPhase() for NS (ns.h) - returns Rsol 
//                                   Changed behaviour:  
//                                       Print detailed output record whenever stellartype changes (after star 2 if both change)
// (Unchanged)   LK - Jan 10, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       Added missing includes to Star.cpp, utils.h and utils.cpp (required for some compiler versions)
// 02.05.00      JR - Jan 23, 2020 - New functionality:

// 02.05.06      JR - Mar 02, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                       - fixed m_MassesEquilibrated and associated functions - was erroneously typed as DOUBLE - now BOOL
//                                   Added/changed functionality:

//                                       - tidied up pythonSubmitDefault.py a little:
//                                             - set grid_filename = None (was '' which worked, but None is correct)
//                                             - set logfile_definitions = None (was '' which worked, but None is correct)
//                                             - added logfile names - set to None (COMPAS commandline arguments already exist for these - introduced in v02.00.00)
// 02.05.07      JR - Mar 08, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                       - fixed circularisation equation in BaseBinaryStar::InitialiseMassTransfer() - now takes new mass values into account

// 02.06.02      JR - Mar 15, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                       - removed commented RLOF printing lines in constant.h (somehow that was lost in some out of sync git merges...)
//                                       - removed commented options no longer used from Options.h and Options.cpp
//                                       - fixed units headers in constants.h - there are now no blank units headers, so SPACE delimited files now parse ok (multiple spaces should be treated as a single space)
//                                       - changed file extention for TAB delimited files to 'tsv'
//                                       - removed "useImportanceSampling" option - not used in code
//                                       - fixed typo in zeta-calculation-every-timestep option in Options.cpp
//                                       - removed redundant OPTIONS->MassTransferCriticalMassRatioHeliumGiant() from qcritflag if statement in BaseBinaryStar::CalculateMassTransfer()
//                                       - fixed OPTIONS->FixedMetallicity() - always returned true, now returns actual value
//                                       - fixed OPTIONS->OutputPathString() - was always returning raw option instead of fully qualified path
//                                       - changed the following in BaseBinaryStar::SetRemainingCommonValues() - erroneously not ported from legacy code:
//                                           (a) m_JLoss = OPTIONS->MassTransferJloss();
//                                           (b) m_FractionAccreted = OPTIONS->MassTransferFractionAccreted();
//                                           (both were being set to default value of 0.0)
//                                       - added OPTIONS->ZetaAdiabaticArbitrary() - option existed, but Options code had no function to retrieve value
//                                       - added OPTIONS->MassTransferFractionAccreted() to options - erroneously not ported from legacy code
//                                   Changed functionality:
//                                       - all options now have default values, and those values will be displayed in the help text (rather than string constants which may be incorrect)
//                                       - boolean options can now be provided with an argument (e.g. --massTransfer false)
//                                       - added ProgramOptionDetails() to Options.cpp and OPTIONS->OptionsDetails() in preparation for change in output functionality
// 02.07.00      JR - Mar 16, 2020 - New/changed functionality:
//                                       - COMPAS Logfiles are created in a (newly created) directory - this way they are all kept together
//                                       - new command line option 'output-container' implemented (also in pythonSubmitDefault.py) - this option allows the user to specify the name of the log files container directory (default is 'COMPAS_Output')
//                                       - if detailed log files are created they will be created in a directory named 'Detailed_Output' within the container directory
//                                       - a run details file named 'Run_details' is created in the container directory.  The file records the run details:
//                                             - COMPAS version
//                                             - date & time of run
//                                             - timing details (wall time, CPU seconds)
//                                             - the command line options and parameters used:
//                                                   - the value of options and an indication of whether the option was supplied by the user or the default value was used
//                                                   - other parameters - calculated/determined - are recorded
//                                   Defect repair:
//                                       - changed "--outut" option name to "--outpuPath" in stringCommands in pythonSubmitDefault.py
// 02.08.00		  AVG - Mar 17, 2020 - Changed functionality:

//  									                   - removed tides code & associated pythonSubmitDefault.py options
//  									                   - removed deprecated options from pythonSubmitDefault.py options
//  									                   - renamed options: mass transfer, iterations -> timestep-iterations
//  									                   - commented AIS Options until fully implemented
// 02.08.01      JR - Mar 18, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - restored initialisation of AIS options in Options.cpp (AIS now defaults off instead of on)
//                                      - fixed retrieval of values for:
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_BOTTOM, 
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_MIDDLE, and 
//                                            - ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW_TOP 
//                                         in BaseStar::StellarPropertyValue().  Were all previously retrieving same value as ANY_STAR_PROPERTY::LAMBDA_KRUCKOW
//                                      - fixed some comments in BAseBinaryStar.cpp (lines 2222 and 2468, "de Mink" -> "HURLEY")
//                                      - fixed description (in comments) of BinaryConstituentStar::SetPostCEEValues() (erroneously had "pre" instead of "post" - in comments only, not code)
//                                      - fixed description of BaseStar::DrawKickDirection()
// 02.08.02      JR - Mar 27, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - fixed issue #158 RocheLobe_1<CE == RocheLobe_2<CE always
//                                      - fixed issue #160 Circularisation timescale incorrectly calculated
//                                      - fixed issue #161 Splashscreen printed twice - now only prints once
//                                      - fixed issue #162 OPTIONS->UseFixedUK() always returns FALSE.  Now returns TRUE if user supplies a fixed kick velocity via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity command line option
// 02.08.03      JR - Mar 28, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - fixed typo in BaseBinaryStar::ResolveCommonEnvelopeEvent() when calculating circularisation timescale in the case where star2 is the donor: star1Copy was errorneously used instead of star2Copy; changed to star2Copy
//                                      - changed circularisation timescale of binary to be minimum of constituent stars circularisation timescales, clamped to (0.0, infinity)
// 02.09.00      JR - Mar 30, 2020 - Minor enhancements:
//                                      - tightened the conditions under which we allow over-contact binaries - enabling CHE is no longer a sufficient condition after this change: the allow-rlof-at-birth option must also be specified (ussue #164)
//                                      - added printing of number of stars (for SSE) or binaries (for BSE) created to both stdout and Run_Details (issue #165)
//                                      - enhanced grid processing code in main.cpp to better handle TAB characters
// 02.09.01      JR - Mar 30, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - OPTIONS->UseFixedUK() returns TRUE when user supplies -ve value via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity.  Now return TRUE iff the user supplies a value >=0 via --fix-dimensionless-kick-velocity
// 02.09.02      DC - Mar 30, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - Pulsar code fixed by correcting unit of NS radius in NS.cpp (added KM_TO_M constant in constants.h as a part of this),
//                                      correcting initialisation of pulsar birth parameters from GiantBranch.cpp to NS.cpp, adding an extra condition for isolated evolution when the companion loses mass but the NS does not accrete 
//                                      - option MACLEOD was printing wrongly as MACLEOD+2014 for user options, hence corrected it to MACLEOD in Options.cpp
// 02.09.03      JR - Apr 01, 2020 - Defect repairs:
//                                      - reinstated assignment of "prev" values in BaseBinaryStar::EvaluateBinary() (where call to ResolveTides() was removed).  Fixes low DNS count introduced in v02.08.00 caused by removal of ResolveTides() function (and call)
//                                      - commented option --logfile-BSE-be-binaries to match Be-Binary options commented by AVG in v02.08.00
// 02.09.04      JR - Apr 03, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - removed IsUSSN() from IsSNEvent() definition in BinaryConstituentStar.cpp (USSN flag indicates just US, not USSN. Needs to be tidied-up properly)
// 02.09.05	     IM - Apr 03, 2020 - Defect repair:
//  		                            - fixed timescale calculation issue for newly created HeHG stars (from stripped EAGB stars); fixes drop in CO core mass
// 02.09.06      JR - Apr 07, 2020 - Defect repair:
//                                      - corrected calculation in return statement for Rand::Random(const double p_Lower, const double p_Upper) (issue #201)

//                                      - restored property names in COMPASUnorderedMap<STAR_PROPERTY, std::string> STAR_PROPERTY_LABEL in constants.h (issue #218) (was causing logfile definitions files to be parsed incorrectly)
// 02.09.10	     IM - Apr 12, 2020 - Minor enhancement: added Mueller & Mandel 2020 remnant mass and kick prescription, MULLERMANDEL
//  			                     Defect repair: corrected spelling of output help string for MULLER2016 and MULLER2016MAXWELLIAN
// 02.10.01	     IM - Apr 14, 2020 - Minor enhancement: 
//  				                            - moved code so that SSE will also sample SN kicks, following same code branch as BSE

// 02.10.05      JR - Apr 26, 2020 - Enhancements:
//                                      - Issue #239 - added actual random seed to Run_Details
//                                      - Issue #246 - changed Options.cpp to ignore --single-star-mass-max if --single-star-mass-steps = 1.  Already does in main.cpp.
// 02.10.06      JR - Apr 26, 2020 - Defect repair:

//                                      - Set He core mass to equal the CO core mass when the He shell is stripped (see issue #277)
//                                      - Ultra-stripped SNe are set at core collapse (do not confusingly refer to stripped stars as previously, see issue #189)

//                                      - Removed calculations of ZetaThermal and ZetaNuclear (these were previously incorrect because they relied on the evolution of a stellar copy which reverted to BaseStar and therefore didn't have the correct behaviour)
//                                      - Fixed CalculateZadiabatic to use ZetaAdiabaticArbitrary rather than ZetaThermalArbitrary; removed the latter
//                                      - Capped He core mass gain during shell H burning for CHeB and TPAGB stars, whose on-phase evolution now ends promptly when this limit is reached; this change also resolves issue #315 (higher mass SN remnants than total stellar mass)

//                                      - ONeWDs can now undergo ECSN if their mass rises above MECS=1.38 solar masses (previously, they could only undergo CCSN on rising above 1.38 solar masses).  ONeWD::CalculateInitialSupernovaMass now returns MCBUR1 rather than 5.0 to ensure this happens
//                                      - BaseStar::CalculateMaximumCoreMassSN() has been removed - it is superfluous since  GiantBranch::CalculateCoreMassAtSupernova_Static does the same thing
//                                      - Some misleading comments in TPAGB dealing with SNe have been clarified
//                                      - Option to set MCBUR1 [minimum core mass at base of the AGB to avoid fully degenerate CO core formation] to a value different from the Hurley default of 1.6 solar masses added, Issue #65 resolved
//                                      - Removed unused Options::SetToFiducialValues()

//                                      - changed call to (now) utils::SolveKeplersEquation() in BaseStar::CalculateSNAnomalies() to accept tuple with error and show error/warning as necessary
//                                      - removed call to std::cerr from utils::SolveQuadratic() - now returns error if equation has no real roots
//                                      - changed call to utils::SolveQuadratic() in GiantBranch::CalculateGravitationalRemnantMass() to accept tuple with error and show warning as necessary
//                                      - changed RadiusEqualsRocheLobeFunctor() in BinaryBaseStar.h to not use the SHOW_WARN macro (can't uset ObjectId() function inside a templated function - no object)
//                                      - changed COMMANDLINE_STATUS to PROGRAM_STATUS (better description)
//                                      - moved ERROR:NONE to top of enum in constants.h (so ERROR = 0 = NONE - makes more sense...)
//                                      - added new program option '--enable-warnings' to enable warning messages (via SHOW_WARN macros).  Default is false.  SHOW_WARN macros were previously #undefined
// 02.13.09     RTW - Aug 21, 2020  - Code cleanup:
// 									    - Created changelog.txt and moved content over from constants.h
// 									    - Changed OrbitalVelocity to OrbitalAngularVelocity where that parameter was misnamed
// 									    - Changed Pre/PostSNeOrbitalVelocity to OrbitalVelocityPre/PostSN for consistency
// 									    - Added and updated physical conversion constants for clarity (e.g MSOL to MSOL_TO_KG)
// 									    - Removed ID from output files, it is confusing and superceeded by SEED
// 									    - Removed 'Total' from TotalOrbital(Energy/AngularMomentum)

//                                      - Removed several stored options (e.g., m_OrbitalAngularVelocity, m_RocheLobeTracker, etc.) to recompute them on an as-needed basis
//                                      - Removed some inf values in detailed outputs
//                                      - Slight speed-ups where feasible
//                                      - Shift various calculations to only be performed when needed, at printing, and give consistent values there (e.g., OmegaBreak, which was never updated previously)
//                                      - Remove a number of internal variables
//                                      - Declare functions constant where feasible
//                                      - Remove options to calculate Zetas and Lambdas at every timestep; variables that only appear in detailed outputs should not be computed at every timestep in a standard run
//                                      - Update documentation
//                                      - Remove postCEE binding energy (meaningless and wasn't re-computed, anyway)
// 02.13.12     IM - Aug 23, 2020   - Enhancement:
//                                      - More cleaning, removed some of the unnecessary prime quantities like m_SemiMajorAxisPrime, m_EccentricityPrime, etc.
//                                      - Thermal timescales are now correctly computed after the CE phase
//                                      - Detailed output passes a set of self-consistency checks (issue #288)

//                                      - Address issue #70 by stopping evolution if the binary is touching
//                                      - Check for merged binaries rather than just touching binaries in Evaluate
//                                      - Minor cleaning (e.g., removed unnecessary CheckMassTransfer, which just repeated the work of CalculateMassTransfer but with a confusing name)

//                                      - Fixed issue #347: CalculateMassTransferOrbit was not correctly accounting for the MT_THERMALLY_LIMITED_VARIATION::RADIUS_TO_ROCHELOBE option

//                                      - SSE Parameters files moved to "DETAILED_OUTPUT" folder (they are analogous to BSE_Detailed_Output files)
//                                      - implemented SSE Switch Log and BSE Switch Log files (record written at the time of stellar type switch - see documentation)
//                                      - implemented SSE Supernova log file - see documentation (issue #253)
//                                      - added TIMESCALE_MS as a valid property in BaseStar::StellarPropertyValue().  The TIMESCALE_MS value in the SSE_Parameters file was being printed as "ERROR!" and nobody noticed :-)  It now prints correctly.

//                                      - Removed unnecessary supernova phi rotation - it was added to agree with Simon's original definition, and to allow for seeds to reproduce the same SN final orbit. 
//                                      -   Removing it means seeds won't reproduce the same systems before and after, but populations are unaffected.

//
//                                      - 'CHE_Option' header string changed to 'CHE_Mode'.  A few typos fixed in header strings.

//                                          - records initial parameters and result (final stellar type) 
//                                          - useful when detailed output is not required
//                                      - Fix for Issue #439
//                                      - Fixed typo in LogfileSwitchLog() in Options.h - only affected situation where user specified switchlog filename (overriding default filename)
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseBinaryStar - never used in BSE code
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseStar - use OPTIONS->LuminousBlueVariableFactor()
//                                      - Removed m_WolfRayetFactor variable from BaseBinaryStar - never used in BSE code
//                                      - Removed m_LBVfactor variable from BaseStar - use OPTIONS->WolfRayetFactor()
// 02.17.01     RTW - Nov 10, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Added in Schneider 2020 remnant mass prescriptions (standard and alternative)
//                                      - Added parameter MassTransferDonorHistory, as required for above prescription, which tracks the MT donor type (from which the MT Case can be established)
// 02.17.02     RTW - Nov 13, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Cleaned up the demo plotting routine so that the plot produced is the plot we use in the methods paper
// 02.17.03     JR - Nov 13, 2020   - Enhancements, code cleanup
//                                      - Added metallicity-distribution option: available distributions are ZSOLAR and LOGUNIFORM (see documentation)
//                                          - Added metallicity-min and metallicity-max options (for metallicity-distribution option)
//                                          - Metallicity is sampled if not explicitly specified via the --metallicity option - this was existing functionality, but
//                                            no distribution was implemented: sampling always returned ZSOLAR.  This change adds the LOGUNIFORM distribution, and 'formalises' the ZSOLAR 'distribution'.
//                                      - Added MASS to default SSE_SYSTEM_PARAMETERS_REC
//                                      - Removed AIS code
//                                      - Removed variable 'alpha' from BinaryCEDetails struct - use OPTIONS->CommonEnvelopeAlpha()
//                                          - Removed BINARY_PROPERTY::COMMON_ENVELOPE_ALPHA - use PROGRAM_OPTION::COMMON_ENVELOPE_ALPHA
//                                      - Issue #443: removed eccentricity distribution options FIXED, IMPORTANCE & THERMALISE (THERMALISE = THERMAL, which remains) 
// 02.17.04     JR - Nov 14, 2020   - Defect repairs
//                                      - Added CalculateRadiusOnPhase() and CalculateLuminosityOnPhase() to class BH (increases DNS yield)
//                                      - Added metallicity to sampling conditions in BaseBinaryStar constructor (should have been done when LOGUNIFORM metallicity distribution added)
// 02.17.05     TW - Nov 16, 2020   - Defect repairs
//                                      - Issue #444
//                                          - Fixed typo in synchronisation timescale
// 02.17.06     RTW - Nov 17, 2020  - Bug fix:
//                                      - Fixed Schneider remnant mass inversion from logRemnantMass^10 to 10^logRemnantMass, added some comments in the same section
// 02.17.07     TW - Nov 17, 2020   - Enhancements, code cleanup
//                                      - Issue #431
//                                          - Added option to change LBV wind prescription: choices are NONE, HURLEY_ADD, HURLEY and BELCYZNSKI
//                                      - Replaced numbers with constants for luminosity and temperature limits in mass loss
//                                      - Consolidated checks of luminosity for NJ winds within function
//                                      - NOTE: the above makes sure luminosity is checked before applying NJ winds for MS stars, this was not previously the case but I think it should be
// 02.17.08     JR - Nov 19, 2020   - Enhancements, code cleanup
//                                      - Added orbital-period-distribution option (see not in Options.cpp re orbital period option)
//                                      - Added mass-ratio option
//                                      - Updated default pythonSubmit to reflect new options, plus some previous omissions (by me...)
//                                      - Minor typo/formatting changes throughout
//                                      - Updated docs for new options, plus some typos/fixes/previous omissions
// 02.17.09     RTW - Nov 20, 2020  - Bug fix:
//                                      - Removed corner case for MT_hist=8 stars in the Schneider prescription (these should be considered Ultra-stripped)
// 02.17.10     RTW - Nov 25, 2020  - Enhancement:
//                                      - Cleaned up Schneider remnant mass function (now uses PPOW), and set the HeCore mass as an upper limit to the remnant mass
// 02.17.11     LVS - Nov 27, 2020  - Enhancements:
//                                      - Added option to vary all winds with OverallWindMassLossMultiplier
