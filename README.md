# Compact Object Mergers: Population Astrophysics & Statistics

[//]: ## (Outline features)
COMPAS is a publicly available rapid binary population synthesis code (https://compas.science/) that is designed so that evolution prescriptions and model parameters are easily 
adjustable.  COMPAS draws properties for a binary star system from a set of initial distributions, and evolves it from zero-age main sequence to the end of its life as two compact 
remnants.  It has been used for inference from observations of gravitational-wave mergers, Galactic neutron stars, X-ray binaries, and luminous red novae.

## Acknowledgements
If you use this code or parts of this code for results presented in a scientific publication, we would greatly appreciate if you send us your paper reference and make your input settings and output data publicly available by uploading it to the [COMPAS Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/compas/). Please also kindly include citations to our COMPAS methods paper https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210910352T/abstract. As the public COMPAS code is a product of work by the entire COMPAS collaboration over many years, we kindly request that, in recognition of this team effort, the paper is cited as “Team COMPAS: J. Riley et al.”. An example bibtex code is:
