**C**\ ompact **O**\ bject **M**\ ergers: **P**\ opulation **A**\ strophysics and **S**\ tatistics
is a publicly available rapid stellar / binary population synthesis code designed so that evolution prescriptions and model parameters are 
easily adjustable. COMPAS draws properties for a binary star system from a set of initial distributions, and evolves it from 
zero-age main sequence to the end of its life as two compact remnants. It has been used for inference from observations of 
gravitational-wave mergers, Galactic neutron stars, X-ray binaries, and luminous red novae.
