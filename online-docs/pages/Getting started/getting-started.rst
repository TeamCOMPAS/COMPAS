Getting started
===============

COMPAS is a platform for the exploration of populations of single stars and compact binaries formed through isolated binary evolution. 
The COMPAS population synthesis code is flexible, fast and modular, allowing rapid simulation of binary star evolution. The complete 
COMPAS suite includes the population synthesis code together with a collection of tools for sophisticated statistical treatment of the 
synthesised populations.

To start using COMPAS, get a copy of the code, and install the libraries and tools required to build and run COMPAS:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   ./git-details
   ./COMPAS-dependencies
   ./building-COMPAS
   ./dev-git-workflow

Once you have completed the steps shown above, you're ready to run COMPAS. The :doc:`COMPAS User Guide <../User guide/user-guide>`
explains in detail how to run COMPAS, but to check that COMPAS is installed correctly, and to get a taste of what running COMPAS looks
like, you could try the :doc:`COMPAS Tutorial <../User guide/Tutorial/example-compas-run>`.
