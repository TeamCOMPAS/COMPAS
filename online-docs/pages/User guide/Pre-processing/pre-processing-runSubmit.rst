runSubmit.py
============

runSubmit.py is a Python script that, in conjunction with a :doc:`YAML file<./pre-processing-yaml>`, constructs and
executes the operating system command that runs COMPAS. This is a convenient method of running COMPAS when the number
of COMPAS options to be specified is large, or for users that are not familiar with operating system command-line
arguments.

Refer to :doc:`Running COMPAS via Python<../Running COMPAS/running-via-python>` for more details.
