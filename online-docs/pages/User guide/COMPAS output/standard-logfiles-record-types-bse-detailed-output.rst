BSE detailed output file record types
=====================================

#. Record describes the initial state of the binary
#. Record was logged immediately following stellar timestep (i.e. the evolution of the constituent stars for a single timestep)
#. Record was logged immediately following binary timestep (i.e. the evolution of the binary system for a single timestep)
#. Record was logged immediately following the completion of the timestep (after all changes to the binary and components)
#. Record describes the final state of the binary
#. Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during a common envelope event
#. Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during a mass transfer event
#. Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during mass resolution
#. Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during mass equilibration for CHE
#. Record was logged immediately following a mass transfer event
#. Record was logged immediately following winds mass loss
#. Record was logged immediately following a common envelope event
#. Record was logged immediately following a supernova event
#. Record was logged immediately following mass resolution (i.e. after winds mass loss & mass transfer complete)
#. Record was logged immediately following a merger after mass resolution
