BSE detailed output file record types
=====================================

Following is a list of the BSE Detailed Output file record type numbers and corresponding symbolic names, and their meaning:

1. INITIAL_STATE |br|
   Record describes the initial state of the binary
#. POST_STELLAR_TIMESTEP |br|
   Record was logged immediately following stellar timestep (i.e. the evolution of the constituent stars for a single timestep)
#. POST_BINARY_TIMESTEP |br|
   Record was logged immediately following binary timestep (i.e. the evolution of the binary system for a single timestep)
#. TIMESTEP_COMPLETED |br|
   Record was logged immediately following the completion of the timestep (after all changes to the binary and components)
#. FINAL_STATE |br|
   Record describes the final state of the binary
#. STELLAR_TYPE_CHANGE_DURING_CEE |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during a common envelope event
#. STELLAR_TYPE_CHANGE_DURING_MT |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during a mass transfer event
#. STELLAR_TYPE_CHANGE_DURING_MASS_RESOLUTION |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during mass resolution
#. STELLAR_TYPE_CHANGE_DURING_CHE_EQUILIBRATION |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a stellar type change during mass equilibration for CHE
#. POST_MT |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a mass transfer event
#. POST_WINDS |br|
   Record was logged immediately following winds mass loss
#. POST_CEE |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a common envelope event
#. POST_SN |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a supernova event
#. POST_MASS_RESOLUTION |br|
   Record was logged immediately following mass resolution (i.e. after winds mass loss & mass transfer complete)
#. POST_MASS_RESOLUTION_MERGER |br|
   Record was logged immediately following a merger after mass resolution
#. PRE_STELLAR_TIMESTEP |br|
   Record was logged immediately prior to stellar timestep (i.e. the evolution of the constituent stars for a single timestep)
