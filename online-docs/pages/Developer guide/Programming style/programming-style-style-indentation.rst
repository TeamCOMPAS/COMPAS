Indentation
===========

There is ongoing debate in the programming community as to whether indentation should be achieved using spaces or tabs (strange, but true...). 
The use of spaces is more common. Unfortunately a mix of spaces and tabs doesn’t work well with some editors - we should settle on one method and 
try to stick to it.  COMPAS (so far) has a mix of both – no matter which convention we choose, once there are instances of both in the code it's 
hard to recover.  So while using tabs is probably preferred, use whatever is convenient (pragmatism is your friend...). 

COMPAS (mostly) uses an indentation size of 4 spaces - again we should settle on a size and stick to it.
