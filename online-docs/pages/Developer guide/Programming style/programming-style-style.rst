Programming style & conventions
===============================

The goal of coding to a suggested style is readability and maintainability – if many developers implement code in COMPAS with their own coding
style, readability and maintainability will be more difficult than if a consistent style is used throughout the code. Strict adherence isn’t 
really necessary, but it will make it easier on all COMPAS developers if the coding style is consistent throughout.
