Programming style
=================

Everyone has their own preferences and style, and the nature of a project such as COMPAS will reflect that. However, there is a need
to suggest some guidelines for programming style, naming conventions etc. Following is a description of some of the elements of 
programming style and naming conventions used to develop COMPAS v2. These may evolve over time.
