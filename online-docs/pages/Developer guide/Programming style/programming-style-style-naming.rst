Naming conventions
------------------

COMPAS (so far) uses the following naming conventions:

- All variable names should be in camelCase – don’t use underscore to separate words.
- Function names should be in camelCase, beginning with an uppercase letter. Function names should be descriptive.
- Class member variable names are prefixed with 'm\_', and the character immediately following the prefix should be uppercase (in most cases – sometimes, for well-known names or words that are always written in lowercase, lowercase might be used).
- Local variable names are just camelCase, beginning with a lowercase letter (again, with the caveat that sometimes, for well-known names or words that are always written in uppercase, uppercase might be used).
- Function parameter names are prefixed with 'p\_', and the character immediately following the prefix should be uppercase (again, with the caveat that sometimes, for well-known names or words that are always written in lowercase, lowercase might be used).
