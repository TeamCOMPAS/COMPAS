Logging type definitions (LogTypedefs.h)
========================================

``LogTypedefs.h`` is the COMPAS ``C++`` logging type definitions header file.

``LogTypedefs.h`` is where developer-defined types that pertain directly to the COMPAS logging functionality (including the
definitions of the default record composition for the various log files) are defined.  Non-logging tyedefs are listed in 
``typedefs.h``.
