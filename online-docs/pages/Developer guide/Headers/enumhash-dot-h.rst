Enum hash class definition (EnumHash.h)
=======================================

``EnumHash.h`` is where the enum hash class and the type alias ``COMPASUnorderedMap`` are defined. The enum hash class allows the use
of enum hashes for maps - this feature was not present in C++11 (though see the comment in ``EnumHash.h``).

The hash class and type alias for ``COMPASUnorderedMap`` encapsulated in a single file so it can be included as necessary.
