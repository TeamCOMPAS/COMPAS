\subsubsection{Program Options}\label{sec:Services_OPTIONS}

A Program Options service is provided encapsulated in a singleton object (an instantiation of the Options class).

The Options class member variables are private, and public getter functions have been created for the program options currently used in the code.

The Options service can be accessed by referring to the Options::Instance() object.  For example, to retrieve the value of the \textit{\texttt{-{}-}quiet} program option, call the Quiet() getter function:

\tabto{3em}bool quiet = Options::Instance()\rarr{Quiet();}

\medskip
Since that could become unwieldy, there is a convenience macro to access the Options service.  The macro just defines "OPTIONS" as "Options::Instance()", so retrieving the value of the \textit{\texttt{-{}-}quiet} program option can be written as:

\tabto{3em}bool quiet = OPTIONS\rarr{Quiet();}

\medskip
The Options service must be initialised before use.  Initialise the Options service by calling the Initialise() function:

\tabto{3em}COMMANDLINE\_STATUS programStatus = OPTIONS\rarr{Initialise(argc, argv);}

(see \textbf{constants.h} for details of the COMMANDLINE\_STATUS type)
