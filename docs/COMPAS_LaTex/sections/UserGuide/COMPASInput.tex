\subsection{COMPAS Input}\label{sec:COMPASInput}

COMPAS provides wide-ranging functionality and affords users much flexibility in determining how the synthesis and evolution of stars (single or binary) is conducted.  Users configure COMPAS functionality and provide initial conditions via the use of program options, described in Appendix~\crossref{sec:ProgramOptions}. Initial conditions can also be provided via Grid files, described below.

A convenient method of managing the many program options provided by COMPAS (Appendix~\crossref{sec:ProgramOptions}) is the example Python script provided in the COMPAS suite. The example script provided is \textit{pythonSubmitDefault.py} -- users should copy and modify their copy of the script to match their experimental requirements. Refer to the \textbf{Getting Started Guide} for more details.
