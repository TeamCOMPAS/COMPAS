# How to recreate/edit the main sequence lifetime plot from the COMPAS methods paper

This folder contains everything you need to reproduce (or edit!) the main sequence plot from the methods paper. This one is a little simpler than some of the other plots as it comes directly from the fitting formulae in Hurley+00 and hence can be created without running COMPAS.

Therefore all you need to do is open `make_fig_7.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab/notebook and run the whole thing to create the figure (and learn how to change it).
