# sample standard log file specifications file

# the '#' character and anything following it on a single line is considered a comment
# (so, lines starting with '#' are comment lines)

# case is not significant
# specifications can span several lines
# specifications for the same log file are cumulative
# if a log file is not specified in this file, the default specification is used


# BSE System Parameters
# start with the default BSE System Parameters specification and add:
bse_sysparms_rec += {                                                    # set the BSE System Parameters specification to:
    BINARY_PROPERTY::OPTIMISTIC_COMMON_ENVELOPE,			# Optimistic CE flag
    BINARY_PROPERTY::IMMEDIATE_RLOF_POST_COMMON_ENVELOPE,                # Flag to indicate if either star overflows its Roche lobe immediately following common envelope event.
    BINARY_PROPERTY::COMMON_ENVELOPE_EVENT_COUNT,
    BINARY_PROPERTY::SYSTEMIC_SPEED,
}


# BSE Double Compas Objects
# start with the default Double Compas Objects specification and add:
BSE_DCO_Rec += {
    BINARY_PROPERTY::OPTIMISTIC_COMMON_ENVELOPE,
    BINARY_PROPERTY::IMMEDIATE_RLOF_POST_COMMON_ENVELOPE,
    BINARY_PROPERTY::COMMON_ENVELOPE_EVENT_COUNT,
    STAR_1_PROPERTY::METALLICITY,
    STAR_1_PROPERTY::MASS_TRANSFER_DONOR_HISTORY,
    STAR_2_PROPERTY::MASS_TRANSFER_DONOR_HISTORY,
